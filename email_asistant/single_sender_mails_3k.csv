0,allen-p,Here is our forecast
1,allen-p,"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  

My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time."

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list

Phillip,
 Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, 
on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic 
consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time 
consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the 
inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can 
arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the 
future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 
The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to 
themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this 
project.

I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now 
we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list


From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated 
positions, I think we still have the following issues:
We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had 
three meetings which brought out very different issues from different 
traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader 
requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.
We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to 
be outside the scope of position consolidation.

Things left to do:
I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to 
make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this 
project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.
Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this 
project and which fall out of scope.
For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and 
work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.
Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all 
drill downs.
Use the above to formulate a project plan.

Things requested thus far (no particular order):
Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal 
ticker.
Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that 
add up existing position manager rows/columns).
New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, 
transport, swaps, options, ...
Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values 
of all curves on which the desk has a position.
Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be 
shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid 
would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.
Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the 
appropriate positions to show for each:
Gas Daily for monthly index,
Physical gas for Nymex,
Physical gas for Inside Ferc,
Physical gas for Mid market.
Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of 
using official valuations.
Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.
Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:
Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility 
skew and correlations.
Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  
Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a 
gamma grid.
Valuation of Gas Daily options.
A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.
Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.
Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position 
manager.
Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, 
prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.
Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.
Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of 
individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.
Benchmark positions in TDS.
Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit 
and explicit position break out issues.

-- Allan.

PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for 
transport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that 
point."

Westgate

Enclosed are demographics on the Westgate site from Investor's Alliance.
Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package
on San Marcos that you received earlier.
If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know.
Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project?

San Marcos
The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for
sale and approved for 134 units.  The land is selling for $2.50 per square
foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West
San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.

Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes
and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25
per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and
$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This
property will have the best location for student housing of all new
projects, just as the duplexes do now.

If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there
is a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not
yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will
know more on this question later today.

Liane,

 As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt to 
manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  It appears that a single 
buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above 
market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades, 
offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were 
bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index 
calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated 
financial swaps for San Juan.

 We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from 
September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from 
Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage 
firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a 
trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas 
daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread 
relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:

 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater 
than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 

 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & 
Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and 
       October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that 
are dramatically different.


 I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the 
trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to 
determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are 
outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in 
establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at 
$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the 
calculation of index.

 It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to 
conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me 
anytime I can assist you towards this goal.

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of

Jeff, 
?
Is the closing today?? After reviewing the  agreement?I find it isn't binding 
as far as I can determine.? It is  too vague and it doesn't sound like 
anything an attorney or title company  would?draft for a real estate 
closing--but, of course, I could be  wrong.? 
?
If this?closing is going to take place without  this agreement then there is 
no point in me  following up on this?document's validity.? 
?
I will just need to go back to my closing documents  and see what's there and 
find out where I am with that and deal with this as  best I can.
?
I guess I was expecting something that would be an  exhibit to a recordable 
document or something a little more exact, or  rather?sort of a contract.? 
This isn't either.? I tried to get a  real estate atty on the phone last 
night but he was out of pocket.? I  talked to a crim. atty friend and he said 
this is out of his area but doesn't  sound binding to him.? 
?
I will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's  transaction?and take a look at 
that but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature? is even 
needed to complete this transaction.?  I am in after 12 noon if there is any 
need to contact me regarding the  closing.
?
I really do not want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myself 
and I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn't 
seem to be something required for a closing.? In  the event you do need my 
signature on something like this I would rather have  time to have it 
reviewed before I accept it.

Happy B-day. Email me your phone # and I will call you.

Keith"
37,allen-p,"Kathy,

Regarding the guest password for gas daily, can you please relay the 
information to Mike Grigsby at 37031 so he can pass it along to the user at 
gas daily today.  I will be out of the office on Friday.

thank you

Phillip"
38,allen-p,"John,

 Denver's short rockies position  beyond 2002 is created by their Trailblazer 
transport.  They are unhedged 15,000/d in 2003 and 25,000/d in 2004 and 
2005.  

 They are scrubbing all their books and booking the Hubert deal on Wednesday 
and Thursday.

Phillip"
39,allen-p,"Jim,

Is there going to be a conference call or some type of weekly meeting about all the regulatory issues facing California this week?  Can you make sure the gas desk is included.

Phillip"
40,allen-p,"George,

 Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate 
project:

 Ownership Structure

 What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner?

 What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what 
capacity(regarding ownership and 
 liabilities)?

 Who owns the land? improvements?

 Who holds the various loans?

 Is the land collateral?

 Investment
 
 What happens to initial investment?

 Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?
 
 Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?

 When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment 
schedule?

 Investment Return

 Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?

 Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits 
are distributed?

 Debt

 Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral 
is associated with each 
 loan?

 Improvement

 Construction

 Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.

 Terms of each loan?

 Uses of Funds

 How will disbursements be made?  By whom?

 What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing 
for investors?

 Reports to track expenses vs plan?

 Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?

 What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get 
paid a markup on subcontractors as a 
 general contractor and paid gain out of profits?

 Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses 
before the ultimate payout of profits?

 Design and Construction
 
 When will design be complete?

 What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?

 What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction 
planning and permitting?

 Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, 
vendors, and other professionals? 
 Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?

 Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to 
use? Names?

These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor 
in a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn as
much as possible from the process.

Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls


Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

42,allen-p,"George,

 Here sales numbers from Reagan:

 
 

 As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The 
1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the 
units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units 
under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with 
competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals 
actually done to date.   

 Let me know what you think.  I will follow up with an email and phone call 
about Cherry Creek.  I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was 
rejected on the De Ville property.

Phillip Allen"
43,allen-p,"Jeff,

 What is up with Burnet?

Phillip"
44,allen-p,"Jeff,

 I need to see the site plan for Burnet.  Remember I must get written 
approval from Brenda Key Stone before I can sell this property and she has 
concerns about the way the property will be subdivided.    I would also like 
to review the closing statements as soon as possible.

Phillip"
45,allen-p,"Lucy,

I want to have an accurate rent roll as soon as possible. I faxed you a copy 
of this file.  You can fill in on the computer or just write in the correct 
amounts and I will input."
46,allen-p,"Brenda,

 I checked my records and I mailed check #1178 for the normal amount on 
August 28th.  I mailed it to 4303 Pate Rd. #29, College Station, TX 77845.  I 
will go ahead and mail you another check.  If the first one shows up you can 
treat the 2nd as payment for October.

 I know your concerns about the site plan.  I will not proceed without 
getting the details and getting your approval.

 I will find that amortization schedule and send it soon.

Phillip"
47,allen-p,"Lucy,


You wrote fewer checks this month.  Spent more money on Materials and less on 
Labor.

Here are my questions on the August bank statement (attached):

1.  Check 1406  Walmart    Description and unit?

2.  Check 1410  Crumps     Detail description and unit?

3.  Check 1411  Lucy      What is this?

6.  Check 1428    Ralph's   What unit?

7.  Check 1438    Walmart?    Description and unit?  


Try and pull together the support for these items and get back to me.

I was aware that Regan Lehman, the lot developer for the entire 70 lot
duplex project, was selling his units in the $180's,  He does have a much
lower basis in the lots than anyone else, but the prime differences are due
to a) he is selling them during construction and b) they are smaller units.
We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of
the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan.  This would produce an average sq
footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his
sales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell
for $203,108.
What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the
rent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own
evaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the
3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we
were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom
units along with the 3-bedroom plan.
Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.

 Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development 
opportunities.

 I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were 
built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for 
 around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated 
that he had more units under construction that would be 
 available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different 
from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor
 plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.  

 As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.  

 Call or email with your thoughts.

Do not underestimate the effects of the Internet economy on load growth.  I 
have been preaching the tremendous growth described below for the last year.  
The utility infrastructure simply cannot handle these loads at the 
distribution level and ultimatley distributed generation will be required for 
power quality reasons.

The City of Austin, TX has experienced 300+ MW of load growth this year due 
to server farms and technology companies.  There is a 100 MW server farm 
trying to hook up to HL&P as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 months 
due to distribution infrastructure issues.  Obviously, Seattle, Porltand, 
Boise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rude 
awakening in the next 2-3 years.

Internet Data Gain Is a Major Power Drain on
                  Local Utilities 

                  ( September 05, 2000 ) 


                  In 1997, a little-known Silicon Valley company called Exodus
                  Communications opened a 15,000-square-foot data center in 
Tukwila. 

                       The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and 
computer servers for the
                  region's growing number of dot-coms. 

                       Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up 
construction
                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than 
a mile from its
                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several 
fiber optic backbones, the
                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and 
eventually
                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, 
Microsoft and Onvia.com. 

                       Exodus is not the only company building massive data 
centers near Seattle.
                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, 
Globix and
                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house 
the networking
                  equipment of the Internet economy. 

                       It is a big business that could have an effect on 
everything from your
                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access 
your favorite Web sites.

                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and 
server farms, are
                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent 
Valley that some
                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and 
Puget Sound
                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, 
high-security
                  facilities. 

                       ""We are talking to about half a dozen customers that 
are requesting 445
                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,"" 
said Karl
                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound 
Energy. ""That is
                  the equivalent of six oil refineries."" 

                       A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, 
the rise of the Internet
                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their 
heads. 

                       Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington 
Utilities and
                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new 
data centers. The
                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing 
residential and business
                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations 
necessary to support
                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 
million each,
                  Karzmar said. 

                       Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to 
bring up the data center
                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. 

                       For the utilities that provide power to homes, 
businesses and schools in the
                  region, this is a new and complex issue. 

                       On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing 
appetite for power --
                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The 
facilities run 24 hours a
                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a 
constant revenue
                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that 
they could
                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital 
expenditures. 

                       Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will 
mean for power rates
                  in the area is still open to debate. 

                       ""These facilities are what we call extremely dense 
loads,"" said Bob Royer,
                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle 
City Light. 

                       ""The entire University of Washington, from stadium 
lights at the football
                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. 
We have data
                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 
and 50 megawatts."" 

                       With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate 
complex in Tukwila is
                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased 
the 1.35 million
                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from 
Boeing Space &
                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 
92 percent of the
                  six-building complex to seven different co-location 
companies. 

                       ""It is probably the largest data center park in the 
country,"" boasts Laurent
                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG 
Communications,
                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama 
Networks all
                  lease space in the office park. 

                       After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, 
Sabey has become an
                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under 
management or
                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole 
claims his firm is
                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in 
the country. 

                       As more people access the Internet and conduct 
bandwidth-heavy tasks
                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for 
co-location space in
                  Seattle continues to escalate. 

                       But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center 
space is growing at a
                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, 
causing similar
                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and 
California. 

                       Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location 
space, plans to nearly
                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. 
While companies
                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many 
high-tech companies
                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such 
as Exodus that
                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic 
management. 

                       ""We have 2 million square feet of space under 
construction and we plan to
                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more 
demand right now
                  than data center space,"" said Steve Porter, an account 
executive at Exodus in
                  Seattle. 

                       The booming market for co-location space has left some 
in the local utility
                  industry perplexed. 

                       ""It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do 
to serve the growth,""
                  said Seattle City Light's Royer. ""The utility industry is 
almost stunned by this, in
                  a way."""

Hi Phillip.  We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team
Selection information.

Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form
we sent you.  The information needed is then easily transferred into the
database directly from that Excel spreadsheet.  If you do not have the
ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still
require additional information.

We need each person's email address.  Without the email address, we cannot
email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can
we send them an automatic reminder via email.  It would also be good to have
each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.

So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need
to instead, provide the needed information via email.

Thank you for your assistance Phillip.

Subject: Receipt of Team Selection Form - Executive Impact & Influence Program


Hi Phillip.  We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team
Selection information.

Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form
we sent you.  The information needed is then easily transferred into the
database directly from that Excel spreadsheet.  If you do not have the
ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still
require additional information.

We need each person's email address.  Without the email address, we cannot
email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can
we send them an automatic reminder via email.  It would also be good to have
each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.

So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need
to instead, provide the needed information via email.

Thank you for your assistance Phillip.

 Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal 
basis and socal/san juan spreads.  I listed the days during bidweek that 
reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints 
before and after bidweek.  



 




 The following observations can be made:

  July 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs 
actual of .79
   2.  Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91
   3.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

  Aug. 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs 
actual of .99
   2.  Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49
   3.  Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the 
monthly postings
   4.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

   

 Enron Online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against 
the index, as well as, spreads to other locations.  Please call with any 
questions.

 Please add Mike Grigsby to the distribution.

 On another note, do you have any idea how Patti is holding up?

Phillip"
86,allen-p,"Brad,

 With regard to Tori Kuykendall, I would like to promote her to commercial 
manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an 
associate.  Her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a 
commercial manager.  I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to 
others in that category at year end.  

 Martin Cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as Tori.  
Hunter would like Martin handled the same as Tori.

 Let me know if there are any issues.

Phillip"
87,allen-p,"Bruce,

Can you stop by and set up my reuters.

Phillip"
88,allen-p,"Lucy,

 The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better.  See if you can add 
these modifications:

 1.  Use a formula in column E.  Add the value in column C to column D.  It 
should read =c6+d6.  Then copy this formula to the rows below.

 2.  Column H needs a formula.  Subtract amount paid from amount owed.  
=e6-g6.

 3.  Column F is filled with the #### sign.  this is because the column width 
is too narrow.  Use you mouse to click on the line beside the 
       letter F.  Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.

 4.  After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to 
this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond.

Phillip"
89,allen-p,"Lucy,
 I got your email with the attachment.  Let's work together today to get this 
done

Phillip"
90,allen-p,you have my approval
91,allen-p,"Lucy,

 We can discuss your email later.  How is progress on creating the 
spreadsheets.  You will probably need to close the file before you attach to 
an email.  It is 2:00.  I really want to make some progress on these two 
files.

Phillip"
92,allen-p,"Lucy,

Please open this excel file and input the rents and names due for this week.  
Then email the file back."
93,allen-p,"Open the ""utility"" spreadsheet and try to complete the analysis of whether it 
is better to be a small commercial or a medium commercial (LP-1).
You will need to get the usage for that meter for the last 12 months.  If we 
have one year of data, we can tell which will be cheaper.  Use the rates 
described in the spreadsheet.  This is a great chance for you to practice 
excel."

Steve has asked that you update the power point below so that it reflects all of the ""stupid regulatory/legislative decisions"" since the beginning of the year.  Ken wants to have this updated chart in his briefing book for next week's ""Ken Lay Tour"" to CA.  

He also wants a forward price curve for both gas and power in CA.  Can we get these three documents by Monday afternoon?"
95,allen-p,"Mac,

 Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:

  Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year
  
  Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf

  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 

   Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:
  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS 
X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share


 That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think 
crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.

 Current price 37
 Nat. Gas 34
 Crude  10

 Total  81

 
 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this 
looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, 
Tosco, and SLB?


Thank you,

Alan,

Steve has asked that you update the power point below so that it reflects all of the ""stupid regulatory/legislative decisions"" since the beginning of the year.  Ken wants to have this updated chart in his briefing book for next week's ""Ken Lay Tour"" to CA.  

He also wants a forward price curve for both gas and power in CA.  Can we get these three documents by Monday afternoon?"

Subject: TRANSPORTATION MODEL

Please plan to attend a meeting on Friday, August 11 at 11:15 a.m. in 30C1 to 
discuss the transportation model.  Now that we have had several traders 
managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss 
any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu 
(Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they 
will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this 
meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is 
comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those 
who are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have 
heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to 
discuss them.

Please let me know if you are unable to attend."

 I am out ot the office on Friday, but Keith Holst will attend.  He has been 
managing the Transport on the west desk.

Phillip"
110,allen-p,"Lucy,

 Now that #44 is rented and you have settled in for a couple of months, we 
need to focus on expenses and recordkeeping.

 First, I want to implement the following changes:

  1.  No Overtime without my written (or email) instructions.
  2.  Daily timesheets for you and Wade faxed to me daily
  3.  Paychecks will be issued each Friday by me at the State Bank
  4.  No more expenditures on office or landscape than is necessary for basic 
operations.


 Moving on to the checkbook, I have attached a spreadsheet that organizes all 
the checks since Jan. 1.
 When you open the file, go to the ""Checkbook"" tab and look at the yellow 
highlighted items.  I have questions about these items.
 Please gather receipts so we can discuss.

Subject: Price for Stanfield Term

I am sending off a follow-up to a bid I submitted to Clark County PUD.  They 
have requested term pricing for Stanfield on a volume of 17,000.  Could you 
give me a basis for the period :

Sept -00 - May 31, 2006
Sept-00 - May 31, 2008

Since I assume you do not keep a Stanfield basis, but rather a basis off 
Malin or Rockies, it would probably make sense to show the basis as an 
adjustment to one of these point.  Also, what should the Mid - Offer Spread 
be on these terms.

Thanks, Mike"

you want to list me as an employer for credit purposes, I will vouch for your

Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.

On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some additional insight?

Roughly speaking, we are looking at a nominal 3750 MMBtu/d for 14 years from 
May 2010 on Elvis, and 3000 MMBtu/d on Cactus fromJune 2004 to April 2022.

Hey Phillip,
I received your note from Celeste.  I am the ENA Staffing Coordinator and 
need for you to fill out the attached Needs Assessment form before I can send 
you any resumes.  Also, would you be interested in the new class?  Analysts 
start with the business units on Aug. 3rd and Assoc. start on Aug. 28th.  We 
are starting to place the Associates and would like to see if you are 
interested.  Please let me know.  

Once I receive the Needs Assessment back (and you let me know if you can wait 
a month,) I will be happy to pull a couple of resumes for your review.  If 
you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

Subject: (Reminder) Update GIS Information

This is a reminder !!!  If you haven't taken the time to update your GIS 
information, please do so.  It is essential that this function be performed 
as soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days 
ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to 
call Ted Bland @ 3-5275.

With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees 
between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to 
have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee 
data.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the 
year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC 
requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their 
profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education 
need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is 
accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to 
hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com 
on the command line of your browser.

The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would 
like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned 
for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please 
contact Kathy Schultea at x33841.  

Your  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.   


Thanks,

Mark,

We are currently back-testing the storage model. 
The enclosed version contains deltas and decision 
variable. 

You mentioned that you have resources to run the model. Please do so.
This will help us to gain experience with the market vs the
model.

I am going to distribute an article by Caminus, an software vendor.
The article illustrates the optionality associated with storage operation
very well.  The Enron Research storage model  is a lot like that, although 
implementation may be
different.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

 I emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company.  I think 
I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from 
him.  Basically, they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some 
price that undercuts the current provider.  Then once their sales are large 
enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit.  
The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage 
the price risk.  This is my best guess.  I will get back to you with more.

Subject: Thoughts on Presentation

It is a shame that the CAISO doesn't provide actual generation by unit.  The 
WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, 
which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes 
the CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but 
there can be a siginificant difference between ""scheduled"" and ""actual"" 
generation.  You are pulling ""scheduled.""  If someone doesn't schedule their 
generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you 
will miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california 
munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, 
if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply 
schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said 
all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on 
the generation side.

On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While 
they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is 
better than the ""scheduled"" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the 
load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.

I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with 
others up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas 
demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, 
especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the 
UEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginal 
consumer then it is obviously a different story.

Let's talk."

Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.

Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.

I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email with comments.

Subject: Transport p&l

Phillip--
I've noticed one thing on your intra-month transport p&l that looks strange 
to me.  Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be 
an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is 
O.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to 
get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and 
I'll take care of it..

On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate 
curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of 
$235,019.   
(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your 
overall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects 
something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal 
#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.
  139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)
  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)
  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)
  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)
  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)
 Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to 
GDP-Kingsgate.

 Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five 
different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for 
withdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a 
Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is 
that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport 
losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  
I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a 
systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems 
that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, 
the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the 
detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it 
appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be 
an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar 
impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in 
case there's something you want to do about it.  The columns below show the 
volumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each.

If we add both balances together the total is $1,140.  I can spread it over 6

Subject:	Re: This morning's Commission meeting delayed   

Phil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed doors ""in smoke filled rooms"", if not directly between Commissioners then among FERC staffers.  Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:

Price caps are almost never the right answer
Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages
Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer
Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable
Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the West

This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.  Ray

Mike McDonald and I met with SW Gas this morning.  They were polite regarding 
asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to 
listen to a proposal.  However, they are very interested in weather hedges to 
protect throughput related earnings.  We are pursuing a confidentiality 
agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable 
us to develop proposals.  Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder 
value by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and by 
reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a 
weather product.

As to your other question.  We have yet to identify or pursue other 
candidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy 
to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our 
opportunities.  We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as we 
implement our strategy in California.

Are there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset 
management deal that we should approach?  Otherwise, we intend to 
systematically identify and work through all the candidates.

Janie,

Thanks for the fax on SW Gas.

We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to 
discuss asset management.  In preparation for that meeting we would like to 
gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  
Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are 
typical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  
How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main 
contacts at SW Gas?

We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our 
control of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably 
have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the 
commissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their 
commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) 
should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month 
index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That 
risk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of 
their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.

As to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are 
there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly 
appreciated.

Thanks,

I checked into executing my options with Smith Barney.  Bad news.  Enron has 
an agreement with Paine Webber that is exclusive.  Employees don't have the 
choice of where to exercise.  I still would like to get to the premier 
service account, but I will have to transfer the money.  

Hopefully this will reach you.

Here is a photograph of a similar house.  The dimensions would be 56'Wide X 41' Deep for the living area.  In addition there will be a 6' deep two story porch across the entire back and 30' across the front.  A modification to the front will be the addition of a gable across 25' on the left side.  The living area will be brought forward under this gable to be flush with the front porch.  

I don't have my floor plan with me at work today, but will bring in tomorrow and fax you a copy.

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.

Phillip -
I applaud you for using your cycle as daily transportation.  Saves on gas, 
pollution and helps keep you strong and healthy.  Enron provides bike racks 
in the front of the building for requests such as this.  Phillip, I wish we 
could accommodate this request; however, The Body Shop does not have the 
capacity nor can assume the responsibility for storing cycles on a daily 
basis.  If you bring a very good lock you should be able to secure the bike 
at the designated outside racks.

Subject: Choosing a style


I am planning to build a house in the Texas hillcountry.  The exterior will
be a farmhouse style with porches on front and back.  I am considering the
following features:  stained and scored concrete floors, an open
living/dining/kitchen concept, lots of windows, a home office, 4 bedrooms
all upstairs.  I want a very relaxed and comfortable style, but not exactly
country.  Can you help?

First one's free. So are the next thousand.

You know it's true: Video games are addictive. Sure, we could
trap you with a free game of Centipede, then kick up the price
after you're hooked. But that's not how shockwave.com operates.
Shockmachine -- the greatest thing since needle exchange -- is
now free; so are the classic arcade games. Who needs quarters?
Get Arcade Classics from shockwave.com, stick 'em in your
Shockmachine and then play them offline anytime you want.

You're not getting a date this Friday night. But you don't care.
You've got a date with Frogger. This frog won't turn into a handsome
prince(ss), but it's sure to bring back great memories of hopping
through the arcade -- and this time, you can save your quarters for
laundry. Which might increase your potential for a date on Saturday.

waiting for you on Shockmachine. Now if you can just find that record
player and a Loverboy album...

Apte.
Matt will be represented by Jeff Shankman.
Vishal joined our group in October.  He was in the Power Trading Group for 
the first 9 months.
I spoke to Jim Fallon and we agreed that he should be in the excellent

and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is 
reportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and 
Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the 
bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double dip"" into 
the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and 
the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of 
the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  
Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term 
power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the 
bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of 
contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge 
loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very 
difficult.

The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state 
would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General 
Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 
billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this 
concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full 
disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the 
details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they 
will support the bond issuance to go forward.

Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB 
31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill 
passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of 
Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for 
community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be 
amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, 
currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should 
get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be 
likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). 
 
According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, 
Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money 
available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated 
that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  
Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The 
Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, 
Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and 
there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.
 
Key Points of the Bridge Financing
Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B
Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B
   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B
   Bear Stearns  $625 M
Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt
Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%
   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%
Current Projected 
Blended IR:  5.38%
Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001

Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time
The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the 
California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion 
authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be 
authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the 
additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing 
power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these 
authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the 
governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond 
amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to 
support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 
6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  
for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  
the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  
be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this 
idea  earlier in the crisis.
 
SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy
At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The 
first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the 
governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is 
August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According 
to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has 
signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis 
and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates 
that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary 
bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  

The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond 
issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) 
stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, 
then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the 
state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and 
passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for 
bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and 
the DWR proportionately from rate payments."

286,allen-p,"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  
Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding 
the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business 
meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is 
even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try 
and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working 
and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet 
just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a 
round table discussion format.  

My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and 
jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time."

Subject: 4-URGENT - OWA Please print this now.


Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute ""john.doe"" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in ""corp/your user 
id"" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Alan,

Steve has asked that you update the power point below so that it reflects all 
of the ""stupid regulatory/legislative decisions"" since the beginning of the 
year.  Ken wants to have this updated chart in his briefing book for next 
week's ""Ken Lay Tour"" to CA.  

He also wants a forward price curve for both gas and power in CA.  Can we get 
these three documents by Monday afternoon?"
297,allen-p,"Tim,

Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our 
Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.

On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its 
forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been 
lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the 
second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The 
outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some 
additional insight?

Thank you,

Phillip"
298,allen-p,"Gary,

I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general 
contractor.  According to Johnnie, I would not be pay any less buying from 
the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within 
his region.  Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.  I believe 
he has sent you my plans.  They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.  

Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from 
the distributor?  If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you 
please email them to me as well?

Thank you for your time.  I am excited about potentially using your product.

Is there any detail on the gas cost proxy.  Which delivery points from which 
publication will be used?  Basically, can you help us get any clarification 
on the language ""the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in 
California""?

Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for 
this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current 
summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made 
to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal 
capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and 
withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 
existed at the time of this bid.

Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above 
assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.

I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email 
with comments.

Phil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed 
doors ""in smoke filled rooms"", if not directly between Commissioners then 
among FERC staffers.  Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that 
the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large 
part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which 
the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman 
began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or 
answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had 
some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:

Price caps are almost never the right answer
Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages
Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer
Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce 
demand, is not acceptable
Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would 
export California's problems to the West

This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty 
strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner 
out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and 
if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the 
agenda.  Hope this info helps.  Ray

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially 
set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever 
the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very 
short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not 
match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.

Subject: CAISO demand reduction

Phillip et al.,

I have been digging into the answer to your question re: demand reduction in 
the West.  Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. 
March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand 
over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for 
temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates 
into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as 
compared with the previous year.

Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary 
reductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other 
forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making 
total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  
This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple 
more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% 
decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the 
retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it 
is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last 
year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in 
Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation 
are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of 
meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general 
economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least 
make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.

Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area 
only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC 
(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO 
portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in 
demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As 
you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum 
smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at 
least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its 
wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several 
mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are 
sharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly 
how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  
Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's 
economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of 
the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I 
think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already 
realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the 
non-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the 
WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around 
6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.

I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you 
with updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I 
hope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any 
questions or need any further information."

The amounts needed to fill in the blanks on Exhibit ""B"" are as follows:

Kipp Flores-Total Contract was $23,600 but $2,375 was paid and only $21,225 
is outstanding.

Kohutek- $2,150 

Cuatro- $37,800


George & Larry paid $3,500 for the appraisal and I agreed to reimburse this 
amount.

The total cash that Keith and I will pay the Sellers is $5,875 ($3,500 
appraisal and $2,375 engineering).    I couldn't find any reference to this 
cash consideration to be paid by the buyers.

Let me know if I need to do anything else before you can forward this to the  
sellers to be executed.

Phillip"
338,allen-p,"John,

Regarding the employment agreement, Mike declined without a counter.  Keith 
said he would sign for $75K cash/$250 equity.  I still believe Frank should 
receive the same signing incentives as Keith.  

Phillip"
339,allen-p,"Thanks for the response.  I think you are right that engaging an architect is 
the next logical step.  I had already contacted Cary Kipp and sent him the 
floor plan.
He got back to me yesterday with his first draft.  He took my plan and 
improved it.  I am going to officially engage Cary to draw the plans.  While 
he works on those I wanted to try and work out a detailed specification 
list.  Also, I would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and 
speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners.  I will be in San Marcos on Friday 
April 13th.  Are there any homes near completion that I could walk through 
that day?  Also can you provide some references?

Once I have the plans and specs, I will send them to you so you can adjust 
your bid.  

Phillip"
340,allen-p,"Do you have a distribution list to send this to all the traders.

Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)"
345,allen-p,https://www4.rsweb.com/61045/
346,allen-p,"Jacques

I am out of the office for the rest of the week.  Have you ever seen anyone 
miss as much work as I have in the last 6 weeks?  I assure you this is 
unusual for me.
Hopefully we can sign some documents on Monday.  Call me on my cell phone if 
you need me.

Phillip"
347,allen-p,"Reagan,

I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts.

Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap?

What role would you play in obtaining financing?  Any experience with FHA 
221(d) loans?  

Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market 
quotes lower yet.  I have received estimates structured as follows:

  5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment
  2%- overhead
  4%- profit

I just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached an 
extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see even 
reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only 
generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about 
such a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down 
to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.  Any ideas?

I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you 
local connections.  I am not discounting those services.   I will be out of 
the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.

Phillip"
348,allen-p,"Cary,

Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple
farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.

A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:

There will be a double porch across the back just like the front
No dormers (Metal roof)
1/2 bath under stairs
Overall dimensions are 55 by 40


What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More
cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.
Reagan
suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want
to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about
bringing the left
side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.
That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front
porch would
be smaller.

I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead
and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a
builder.
I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned
my alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed
sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan
allowed.

Cary,

Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple
farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.

A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:

There will be a double porch across the back just like the front
No dormers (Metal roof)
1/2 bath under stairs
Overall dimensions are 55 by 40


What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More
cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.
Reagan
suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want
to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about
bringing the left
side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.
That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front
porch would
be smaller.

I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead
and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a
builder.
I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned
my alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed
sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan
allowed.

Phillip"
353,allen-p,no problem
354,allen-p,"Reagan,

Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence.  Below is a 
list of questions on the specs:

1.  Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine?  Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less 
and cost about the same?

2.  What type of floor joist would be used?  2x12 or some sort of factory 
joist?

3.  What type for roof framing?  On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?

4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  What 
type of insulation in floors and ceiling?  Batts or blown?  Fiberglass or 
Cellulose?

5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?

6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't know 
the difference between an apron and a stool.

7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent 
cracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?

8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partial 
one out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.

9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under 
the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.

10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermount 
stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.

11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.

12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?

13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?

14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Iron 
railings?

15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price except 
for change orders?

I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but 
this is a start.  I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.  I am going to 
call Cary Kipp to
see about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.

Phillip

355,allen-p,"Larry,

Jacques has sent a document to Claudia for your review.  Just dropping you a 
line to confirm that you have seen it.

Phillip"
356,allen-p,"Jacques,

Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and 
architect?  They have both sent me agreements.  The only payment
that George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect.  I have written 
personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the 
engineer.
I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the 
partnership.  

I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the 
partnership not with me.  Should I wait until the partnership has been 
conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership.

Let me know what you think.

Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates:

Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf 
(rentable)

What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent?

Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again?  You mentioned 2% 
overhead, 3 %  ???, and 5% profit.

Why is profit only 4%? 

Why are the architect fees up to $200K.  I thought they would be $80K.

What is the $617K of profit allowance?  Is that the developers profit to 
boost loan amount but not a real cost?

Total Closing and Application costs of 350K?  That seems very high?  Who 
receives the 2 points?  How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us?

Where is your 1%?  Are you receiving one of the points on the loan?

What is the status on the operating pro forma?  My back of the envelope puts 
NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40% 
expenses.  After debt service that would only leave $122K.  The coverage 
would only be 1.16.

Talk to you this afternoon.

Mike is fine with signing a new contract (subject to reading the terms, of 
course).  He prefers to set strikes over a 3 month period.  His existing 
contract pays him a retention payment of $55,000 in the next week.  He still 
wants to receive this payment.

Phillip"
362,allen-p,"Reagan,

 Here is a photograhph of the house I have in mind.

 Specific features include:

 Stained and scored concrete floors downstairs
 Wood stairs
 Two story porches on front and rear
 Granite counters in kitchens and baths
 Tile floors in upstairs baths
 Metal roof w/ gutters (No dormers)
 Cherry or Maple cabinets in kitchen & baths
 Solid wood interior doors
 Windows fully trimmed
 Crown molding in downstairs living areas
 2x6 wall on west side

 Undecided items include:

 Vinyl or Aluminum windows
 Wood or carpet in upstairs bedrooms and game room
 Exterior stucco w/ stone apron and window trim  or rough white brick on 3-4 
sides
 
 
 I have faxed you the floor plans.  The dimensions may be to small to read.  
The overall dimensions are 55' X 40'.  For a total of 4400 sq ft under roof, 
but 
 only 3800 of livable space after you deduct the garage.  

 Are there any savings in the simplicity of the design?  It is basically a 
box with a simple roof 
 line.  Call me if you have any questions. 713-853-7041.

364,allen-p,"Greg,

Something that I forgot to ask you.  Do you know if Hugo is planning to 
replatt using an administrative process which I understand is quicker than 
the full replatting process of 3 weeks?

Also let me know about the parking.  The builder in San Marcos believed the 
plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code.  The townhomes 
across the street have a serious parking problem.  They probably planned for 
the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms.

Phillip"
365,allen-p,keith holst sent you an email with the details.
366,allen-p,"Jacques,

The agreement looks fine.   My only comment is that George and Larry might 
object to the language that ""the bank that was requested to finance the 
construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs 
of the construction of the Project"".   Technically, that bank lowered the 
loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of 
equity that would be required. 

Did I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.

Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans, 
engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items are 
in a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speaking 
directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear on 
what is the best way to proceed with these consultants.  

The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do we 
need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and 
give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.

Still trying to close the loop on the $15,000 of extensions.  Assuming that 
it is worked out today or tomorrow, I would like to get whatever documents 
need to be
completed to convey the partnership done.  I need to work with the engineer 
and architect to get things moving.  I am planning on  writing a personal 
check to the engineer while I am setting up new accounts.  Let me know if 
there is a reason I should not do this.

I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of 
value and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able to 
use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, 
appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in 
extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like 
earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I 
didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear 
this up.

Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.  
Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and 
the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand, 
conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was 
clean.  What is your inclination?

Call as soon as you have a chance to review.

Let's talk to Matt about the forecast sheets for Socal and PG&E.  He needs to 
work on the TW sheet as well.   Also, I would like him to create a sheet on 
pipeline expansions and their rates and then tie in the daily curves for the 
desk to use.

Mike"
378,allen-p,"Lucy,

Here is the rentroll.

My only questions are about #18, #25, and #37 missed rent.  Any special 
reasons?

It looks like there are five vacancies #2,12,20a,35,40.  If you want to run 
an ad in the paper with a $50 discount that is fine.
I will write you a letter of recommendation.  When do you need it?  You can 
use me as a reference.  In the next two weeks we should really have a good 
idea whether the sale is going through.

FYI Western Price Survey Contacts

Cal-ISO's declaration of Stage Two alert this morning was triggered
in part by decision of Bonneville Power Administration to cease
hour-to-hour sales into California of between 600 MW and 1,000
MW that it had been making for the past week. According to BPA,
it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet
biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in
order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had
been telling California's Department of Water Resources that the
sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.

Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than
yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back.
Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because
of concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sending
exchange energy into California, however.

More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of the
Western Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter."
381,allen-p,"Thanks for the information.  It would be helpful if you would send the 
detailed worksheet that you mentioned.

I am surprised to hear that the only restricted shares left are the ones 
granted this January.  I have always elected to defer any distributions of 
restricted stock.  I believe I selected the minimum amount required to be 
kept in enron stock (50%).   Are you saying that all the previous grants have 
fully vested and been distributed to my deferral account?

Thank you for looking into this issue.

Subject: Bishops Corner, Ltd. -- Restructure or Buyout

Dear Phillip and Keith: 

We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash 
expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of 
all note obligations and design contracts.? 

As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and 
existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, 
and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which 
current unpaid invoices due total $37,325.

Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this 
project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design 
and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of 
our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or 
rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? 

Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a 
percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on 
your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, 
or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the 
second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per 
year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these 
valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the 
forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in 
the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future 
projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per 
month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the 
attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings 
the total net buyout to $78,946.? 

We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we 
offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout 
offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are 
prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? 
If this is your 



choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, 
Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then 
draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the 
Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout 
amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts.

Thank you.

Here is the buyout spreadsheet again with a slight tweak in the format.  The 
summary  presents the numbers as only $1400 in concessions."
388,allen-p,"Gentlemen,

Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to 
date.  I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property is 
still in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot 
and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a 
topographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to 
coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the 
smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going 
to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to 
complete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which 
$14,000 are due now for work completed.  

We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by 
the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can 
continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's 
number is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and 
ask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call 
and he was fine with that.  

Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp 
Flores can be used.

Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left very 
optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.

Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about 
moving this project forward.

Phillip"

390,allen-p,"Jacques,

George finally sent me some information.  Please look over his email.  He 
wants us to buy him out.  Keith and I think this is a joke.  

We still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to 
determine if it has any value going forward.  I don't believe the architect 
work will be of any use to us.  I don't think they deserve any compensation 
for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were 
proposing was unsupportable by the market.  

My version of a buyout is attached.

I need your expert advise.  I am ready to offer my version or threaten to 
foreclose.  Do they have a case that they are due money for their time?  
Since their cost
and fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I 
wouldn't think they would stand a chance.  There isn't any time to waste so I 
want to respond to their offer asap.

Call me with your thoughts.

Phillip

Database for hourly storage activity on Socal.  Begin forecasting hourly and 
daily activity by backing out receipts, using ISO load actuals and backing 
out real time imports to get in state gen numbers for gas consumption, and 
then using temps to estimate core gas load.  Back testing once he gets 
database created should help him forecast core demand.

Subject:  Sagewood Phase II


George,

Thank you for the opportunity to review your financing request for the 
Sagewood
Phase II project.  Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the
project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are a
number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward
on the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a
Bedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjusted
pro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are
acheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about 
500+
units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, 
this,
we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious
effect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requested
loan amount to $8,868,000.

I have summarized our issues as follows:

1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:

     Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment
     Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR
     2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475
     3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417

2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit
turn over.

3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).

4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support
debt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x 
debt
coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.

5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.

6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide
equity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:

     Land -                   $1,121,670
     Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000
     Cash Equity              $1,419,268
     Total                    $2,955,938

7. Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage 
of
actual hard construction costs.

(See attached file: MAPTTRA.xls)




 - MAPTTRA.xls"
398,allen-p,"Darrell,

Today I let the builder/developer know that I would not proceed with his 
excessively high cost estimates.  As he did not have the funds to take on the 
land himself, he was agreeable to turning over the land to me.  I would like 
to proceed and develop the property. 

 My thought is to compare the financing between Bank One and FHA.  I would 
also like to compare construction and development services between what you 
can do and a local builder in San Marcos that I have been speaking with.  
Making a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems to 
be in order.  I am trying to get the status of engineering and architectural 
work to date.  Once again the architect is Kipp Florres and the engineer is 
Quattro Consultants out of Buda.  Let me know if you have an opinion about 
either.

I look forward to working with you.  Talk to you tomorrow.

I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still have
the concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our
project are too high.  I have gathered more information that support my
concerns.  Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around
$10.5 million.  The components are as follows:

     Unit Cost, Site work, &
     builders profit($52/sf)             $7.6 million

     Land                      1.15

     Interim Financing               .85

     Common Areas                     .80

     Total                         $10.4

Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable
to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.

Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A
properties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can
produce the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for
location and the seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize
that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates
that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not
believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.
Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.

After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost
estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  He
feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8
million.  We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.

Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that
we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5
million.   We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon to 
discuss
alternatives.

Here are few questions regarding the 2/16 rentroll:

#2  Has she actually paid the $150 deposit.  Her move in date was 2/6.  It is 
not on any rentroll that I can see.

#9  Explain again what deposit and rent is transferring from #41 and when she 
will start paying on #9

#15  Since he has been such a good tenant for so long.  Stop trying to 
collect the $95 in question.

#33  Missed rent.  Are they still there?

#26  I see that she paid a deposit.  But the file says she moved in on 1/30.  
Has she ever paid rent?  I can't find any on the last three deposits.

#44  Have the paid for February?  There is no payment since the beginning of 
the year.

#33  You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't 
see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit?

The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent.  I need you to 
figure these out immediately.

I emailed you a new file for 2/23 and have attached the last three rentroll 
in case you need to research these questions.

I will not be in the office next week.  If I can get connected you might be 
able to email me at pallen70@hotmail.com.  Otherwise try and work with Gary 
on pressing issues.  If there is an emergency you can call me at 713-410-4679.

Phillip -

George Richards asked that I drop you a line this morning to go over some
details on the San Marcos project.

1.  First, do you know if I am to receive a personal financial statement from
Keith?  I want to make sure my credit write-up includes all the principals in
the transaction.

2.  Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC) 
will
be in the range of 75% - 80%.  The proposed Loan to Value of 75% is within the
acceptable range for a typical Multi-Family deal.  Given the above pro-forma
performance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my credit
officer as an 80% LTC.  This, of course, is subject to the credit officer
signing off on the deal.

3.  The Bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the Developers
deferred profit.  Typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget as
deferred profit has been acceptable.

Thanks,

There have been some updates to the cost.  The principal change is in the
addition of masonry on the front of the buildings, which I estimate will
costs at least $84,000 additional.  Also, the trim material and labor costs
have been increased.  I still believe that the total cost is more than
sufficient, but there will be additional updates.

The manager's unit is columns J-L, but the total is not included in the B&N
total of rentable units.  Rather, the total cost for the manager's unit and
office is included as a lump sum under amenities.  I may add this back in as
a rentable unit and delete is as an amenity.

The financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanent
mortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for the
construction loan approval, therefore, its cost will be absorbed when this
loan is obtained.

Based on either a loan equal to 75% of value or 80% of cost, the
construction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land.

Phillip,

I spoke with AMF's broker today, and they will be satisfied with the deal if
we can get the school to agree to limit the current land use restrictions to
the terms that are in the existing agreement.  They do not want the school
to come back at a later date for something different.  Doug Bell will meet
with a school official on Monday to see what their thoughts are about the
subject.  It would be hard for them to change the current agreement, but AMF
wants something in writing to that effect.  I spoke to AMF's attorney today,
and explained the situation.  They are OK with deal if AMF is satisfied.

AMF's broker said that they will be ready to submit their site plan after
the March 29 hearing.  We may close this deal in April.

The Stage is still on go.  An assumption package has been sent to the buyer,
and I have overnighted a copy of the contract and a description of the
details to Wayne McCoy.

I will be gone Thurs. and Fri. of this week.  I will be checking my

Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies 
forecasts?  I will set up a room with Kim.

Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen:

1.  Review and document systems and processes  -   The handoffs from ERMS, 
TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the 
       parties trying to make improvements.  I think I understand ERMS and 
TAGG but the issues facing 
       scheduling in Unify are grey.

2.  Review and audit complex deals- Under the ""assume it is messed up"" 
policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need 
further      scrutiny.

3.  Review risk books-  Is Enron accurately accounting for physical 
imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?

4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design training 
courses, review progress and make cuts.

5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.  Are we looking at 
everything we should?  Putting a person with a trading mentality should add 
   some value and direction to the group.


In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD 
to work part time to get it done.

Thanks for clearing up the 2/2 file.  Moving on to 2/9, here are some 
questions:




#1 It looks like he just missed 1/26&2/9 of $110.  I can't tell if he still 
owes $47 on his deposit.

#13 I show she missed rent on 1/26 and still owes $140.

#15 Try and follow up with Tomas about the $95.  Hopefully, he won't have a 
bad reaction.

#20b Missed rent?

#26  Has she paid any deposit or rent?

#27 Missed rent?"

After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different 
definitions of cost and profit.  Their version includes the salary of a 
superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third 
party subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of ""construction management"" 
fees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be 
paid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finally 
the builders profit of 1.4 million.

Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out 
of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, if 
they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?  
We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition 
to the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have been 
in the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates and 
the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management 
fee is included.

George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  I will 
review and let you know what I think.

The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention.  They are agreeable to 
the 3 out 4 approval process.

Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  only 
true costs + 1.4 million.

earlier response answered the questions for #3,11,15,20a, and 35.

this question lies in apartment 1,13, and 14, can you update this file and

Subject: AEC Volumes at OPAL

Phillip these are the volumes that AEC is considering selling at Opal over 
the next five years.  The structure they are looking for is a firm physical 
sale at a NYMEX related price.  There is a very good chance that they will do 
this all with one party.  We are definitely being considered as that party.  
Given what we have seen in the marketplace they may be one of the few 
producers willing to sell long dated physical gas for size into Kern River.

What would be your bid for this gas?

This should probably be researched further.  If they can really build this 
many plants it could have a huge impact on the Cal border basis.  Obviously 
it is dependent on what capacity is added on Kern, PGT and TW but it is hard 
to envision enough subscriptions to meet this demand.  Even if it is 
subscribed it will take 18 months to 2 years to build new pipe therefore the 
El Paso 1.2 Bcf/d could be even more valuable.

Here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject

It is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there 
unit is when they move in.  This needs to be written in on their lease.

When you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize 
that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up.

Here is the rentroll for this Friday.  Sorry it is so late.



There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2.

1.  I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank 
is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865.   The missing money on the 
spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.

2.  #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?

3.  #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?

4.  #11 Missed on 2/2?

5.  #13 Missed on 1/26?

6.  #14  missed on 2/2?

7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?

8.  #20a missed on 2/2?

9.  #35 missed on 2/2?

My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.  
You may have sent me a message over the ""chat"" line that I don't remember on 
some of these.  I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the 
bank deposit.

Will have some time today to work on a utility letter.  Tried to call Wade 
last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him.  Will try again today.

I believe that a doctor from Seguin is going to make an offer.  Did you meet 
them?  If so, what did you think?

Phillip"
461,allen-p,"I will email you an updated operating statement with Nov and Dec tomorrow 
morning.  What did the seguin doctor think of the place.  

How much could I get the stagecoach appraised for?  Do you still do 
appraisals?  Could it be valued on an 11 or 12 cap?"
462,allen-p,"Jacques,

Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract?  

The key business points are:

1.  Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate

2.  Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million

3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.

4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?

5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.

With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a 
solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes 
costs.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and I 
would like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to fax 
all invoices within 48 hours.  We also would want online access to the 
checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing 
but invoices were not being submitted.

Let me know if you can draft these agreements.  The GP issue may need some 
tweaking.

Here is a final 12/01 rentroll for you to save.  My only questions are:

1.  Neil Moreno in #21-he paid $120 on 11/24, but did not pay anything on 
12/01.  Even if he wants to swich to bi-weekly, he needs to pay at the 
beginning 
     of the two week period.  What is going on?

2.  Gilbert in #27-is he just late?

My target is to get $225 back out of the stage.  Therefore, I could take a 
sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K.  This would still only 
require $75K cash from the buyer.  After broker fees and a title policy, I 
would net around $20K cash.  

You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or 
higher with the terms described in the 1st email.  Do you want to give the 
New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal.

I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 
years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%.  There are several 
reasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, the 
large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer 
are the three biggest concerns.  

What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the 
buyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come due 
until September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold the 
property.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to make 
the deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinance 
is pushing too far.

Can you clarify the dates in the contract.  Is the effective date the day the 
earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?

Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.  I got your fax from the New 
Braunfels buyer.  If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get 
started on the list.

When we meet,  I would like to address the following issues:

1.)  I had at least 5 people here past midnight on both nights and I have 
several people who have not left before 10:30 this week. 
2.)  It is my understanding that Susan was still booking new day deals on 
Thursday night at 8:30 b/c she did not get deal tickets from the trading 
floor until after 5:00 p.m.
3.)  It is also my understanding that Susan is done with the p&l and 
benchmark part of her book often times by 6:00,  but that what keeps her here 
late is usually running numerous extra models and spreadsheets.  (One 
suggestion might be a permanent IT person on this book.)  (This was also my 
understanding from Kyle Etter,  who has left the company.)

I would like to get this resolved as soon as possible so that Larry can get 
the information that he needs to be effective and so that we can run books 
like this and not lose good people.

Please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the ""Rent Due"" column.  The 
other questions I had about last week's rent are:

#15  Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26.  What is 
going on?

#25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit

#27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.  Why?

I spoke to Jeff Smith.  I think he was surprised that we were set up with 
email and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff know 
that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the 
property.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show 
them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.  

Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right 
now.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet 
but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wade 
continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the 
property's tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better and 
better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.  

Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  It 
is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move 
in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  I 
realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and 
your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be 
working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running 
an errand for the property.

I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this 
time.  We can look at again later in the year.

I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.

13:18 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Cal-ISO Pays $10M To Avoid Rolling Blackouts
Wed -Sources
(This article was originally published Wednesday)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Independent System Operator paid
about $10 million Wednesday for 1,000 megawatts of power from Powerex and
still faced a massive deficit that threatened electricity reliability in the
state, high-ranking market sources familiar with the ISO's operation told
Dow Jones Newswires.
But the ISO fell short of ordering rolling blackouts Wednesday for the third
consecutive day.
The ISO wouldn't comment on the transactions, saying it is sensitive market
information. But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia
Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest
region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid
about $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.
But that still wasn't enough juice.
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts
of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of
$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts
of power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the
$250/MWh price cap.
The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The
municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power
into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP
is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit
claims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville
Power Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the
market at prices 10 times higher.
Powerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying all
transactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000
megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts
- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.
The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state
no matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,
which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having
to compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing
to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.
The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during
a conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency
Wednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared
when the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is
interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.
But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as
a means of attracting additional electricity resources.
""In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,""
Dorinson said.
Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy
unit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &
Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of
the high-priced power.
SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high
wholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by
nearly $1 billion, analysts said. It's still unclear whether retail
customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity
rates or if companies will absorb the costs.

13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South Bay
Pwr Plant
(This article was originally published Wednesday)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California Independent
System Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke Energy
Corp.'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,
Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.
The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state
since Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the
reasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.
About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday,
7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the
ISO.
The ISO manages grid reliability.
As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert
at 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would
dip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid
collapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rolling
blackouts.
The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),
Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE).
Duke's 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representatives
in June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said.

Power Plants
(This article was originally published Wednesday)

   By Jessica Berthold
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--AES Corp. (AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said
Wednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by
some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate
reasons.
The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power
grid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public
Utilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power
plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns,
ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.
The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for
unplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency
for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and
customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be
called on to do so.
As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)
said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday
evening.
Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES
and Dynegy Tuesday evening.
AES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspection
of the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday
morning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron
Thomas said.
Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representatives
returned Wednesday for a full inspection.

   AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits

The Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have
used up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken down
two weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality
Management District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,
Thomas said.
AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire
Huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos
and Redondo Beach plants.
The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES
has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the
company $20 million for polluting.
""We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it,""
Thomas said. ""It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality
district's"" authority.
As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES
could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off
line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.

   Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC

Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday
evening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line
Wednesday.
""I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if you
need to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'"" said Dynegy
spokesman Lynn Lednicky.
Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and
the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could
pose a safety hazard if not repaired.
""We've been doing all we can to get back in service,"" Lednicky said. ""We
even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.""
Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation of
why its units were off line.

2:30 pm on Monday to discuss this issue.  Please let me know if this time 
fits in your schedules.

The probability of building a house this year is increasing.  I have shifted 
to a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I could 
not work out in the plan we discussed previously.  Now, I am leaning more 
towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  One 
wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 
kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage + 
guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  This 
plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the 
courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor 
living.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. 
 The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass 
skylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to have 
single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.  

I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.  I would 
like to come and visit you again this month.  If it would work for you, I 
would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.  I 
would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we 
didn't have time for.  I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan. 

Call or email to let me know if this would work for you.

482,allen-p,"Jeff,

Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about.

1.  Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and 
repairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor 
cost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on 
repairs.

2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite 
manager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has 
interest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager 
that could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to a 
management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager 
onsite.

3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If you 
want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.

4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structure 
this deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.

My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.  This property 
definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.


Sales Price  705,000

1st Lien   473,500

2nd Lien  225,000

Transfer fee    7,500

Cash required   14,500


NOI   100,000

1st Lien    47,292

2nd Lien   23,694

Cash flow  29,014

Cash on cash  200%


These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then 
cash on cash return would be more like 300%.   This doesn't reflect the 
additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years 
for a higher price.

Do you want to reconsider?  Let me know.

=09=09 Subject: CPUC Audit Report on Edison

The following are the highlights from the Executive Summary of the KPMG aud=
it=20
report on Southern California Edison:
=20
I. Cash Needs
Highlights:
SCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=
plete=20
cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20
program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=
s=20
and other measures.=20
Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20
available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=
.8=20
million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20
conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.
II. Credit Relationships
Highlights:
SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20
extend or renew credit as it has become due.
At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.
SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=
lt.=20
Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=
nd=20
payable.
SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond=
=20
indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20
indebtedness if it were feasible to do so.
Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =
its=20
rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade=
=20
issues within the last three weeks.
III. Energy Cost Scenarios
Highlights
This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20
various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=
 such=20
scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.
IV. Cost Containment Initiatives
Highlights
SCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.
The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital=
=20
improvement component as follows (in millions):
Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77
Capital Improvement Costs                383
Total                                             $ 460
The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to=
=20
be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=
om=20
contract employees.
Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the=
=20
most part being deferred to a future date.
SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20
executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20
savings of approximately $92 million.
V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20
Activity)
Highlights:
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20
Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20
includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20
million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s=
=20
Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.
Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=
e=20
end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit=
=20
balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20
D.01-01-018.
Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20
generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20
tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20
expressed in the TRA, are overstated.
TURN Proposal
As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=
RN=20
to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=
s.=20
Our comments are summarized as follows:
The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=
t=20
would not directly generate nor use cash.
The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=
ift=20
costs between two regulatory assets.
TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=
 the=20
revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =
in=20
the TRA is overstated.
VI. Flow of Funds Analysis
Highlights:
In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a=
=20
positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.
During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to=
=20
its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.
Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its=
=20
shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=
on=20
stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=
ve=20
and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.
[there is no Section VII]
=20
VIII. Earnings of California Affiliates
SCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500=
=20
million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20
In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.=
=20
This increase correlates to the increase in market prices
for natural gas for the same period.
A copy of the report is available on the Commission website at=20

That is good news about Leander.  

Now for the stage.  I would like to get it sold by the end of March.   I have 
about $225K invested in the stagecoach, 
 it looks like I need to get around $745K to breakeven.  

I don't need the cash out right now so if I could get a personal guarantee 
and Jaques Craig can 
work out the partnership transfer, I would definitely be willing to carry a 
second lien.  I understand second liens are going for 10%-12%.
Checkout this spreadsheet.





These numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes.   
However,  I am very concerned about the way it is being shown.  Having Lucy 
show it is not a good idea.  I need you to meet the buyers and take some 
trips over to get more familar with the property.  My dad doesn't have the 
time and I don't trust 
Lucy or Wade to show it correctly.  I would prefer for you to show it from 
now on.  

I will have the operating statements complete through December by this

George,

Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders 
profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be 
recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would 
be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.



Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the 
investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned 
earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as 
part of the construction contract.  

Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look 
like here are a few ideas:

 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from 
higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.

 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 
1 complete in November)
      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule
      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule

This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but 
could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule 
must be discussed and agreed upon.

Phillip:

It looks like a deal with the non gas fired QFs is iminent.  One for the gas 
generators is still quite a ways off.  

The non gas fired QFs will be getting a fixed price for 5 years and reverting 
back to their contracts thereafter.  They also will give back 

I would expect that the gas deal using an implied gas price times a heat rate 
would be very very difficult to close.  Don't expect hedgers to come any time 
soon.

I will keep you abreast of developments.

Subject: Status of QF negotiations on QFs & Legislative Update

This from a conference call with IEP tonight at 5 pm:

RE;  Non-Gas-fired QFs -- The last e-mail I sent includes the latest version 
of the IEP proposal.  Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially 
complete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed with 
the IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would ""retain"" $106 million (of 
what, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who 
switched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the 
QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December 
(and maybe earlier).

PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the 
Force Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get 
some assurances of payment. 

SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due 
on 2/2/01.

For gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E's 
purchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements 
(Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be 
resolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.  No discussions on this 
occurred today.

Status of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will 
happen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.  
Plan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg's new bill .  Hydro as security is 
dead. Republicans were very much opposed to it."
495,allen-p,"Patti,

This sounds like an opportunity to land a couple of analyst to fill the gaps 
in scheduling.  Remember their rotations last for one year.  Do you want to 
be an interviewer?

All,

The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that 
need to be addressed immediately.  While we anticipate many new Analysts 
joining Enron this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it 
necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting 
event.  We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting 
approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed.  I am asking that you forward 
this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above).  We will conduct 
first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the 
afternoon.  We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning 
(9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session.  Please submit your 
response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date.  In 
addition, we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking 
one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer.   Thanks in 
advance for your cooperation.

Date: 01/20/01 22:15

As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile 
Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas 
storage number. 

The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the 
forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a 
supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. 

""Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,"" said William Burson, 
a trader. ""It makes the market for natural gas."" 

But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas 
Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the 
storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the 
numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than 
reality. 

""It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what 
we are reporting,"" McGill said. 

As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- 
and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing 
fingers at Wall Street. 

Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently 
stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for 
the rise in gas prices. 

""It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,"" Adik 
told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. 

In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric 
utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. 

Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame 
for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their 
customers and constituents from such price spikes. 

Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take 
precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price 
insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas 
prices before they soared. 

""We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said Paul 
Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. 

But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. 

""There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to 
change,"" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security 
Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. 


Hot topic 

Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In 
many circles, little else is discussed. 

The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is 
facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the 
previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as 
well. 

The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of 
his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial 
pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. 

""It's the talk of the town here,"" he said. 

A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per 
thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile 
to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by 
customers. 

But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand 
cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage 
for winter. 

There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, 
prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information 
Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating 
bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. 

But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, 
including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas 
markets. 

""It's all about the weather,"" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. 

Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York 
traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile 
commodity in the world. 


Setting the price 

In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of 
gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading 
contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had 
widespread influence over gas prices. 

The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon 
as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale 
prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from 
utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what 
they pay for the gas they expect to use. 

There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention 
of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge 
of natural gas. 

But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to 
know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all 
futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to 
their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money 
in a short time. 

As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less 
than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. 
Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's 
weekly storage numbers. 

Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to 
need in the winter. 

Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than 
average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in 
hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. 

Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be 
sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the 
concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. 

Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage 
numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the 
association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. 

But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice 
president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had 
continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. 

""I was getting worried,"" he said. 

Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. 
Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices 
dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. 


Just passing through 

Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but 
pass their fuel costs on to customers. 

Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas 
charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas 
Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. 

Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last 
month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could 
be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve 
energy. 

Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to 
save an average customer about $25 this winter. 

Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an 
extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not 
guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. 

Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left 
customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether 
they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel 
costs. 

On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public 
Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to 
perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. 

""Consumers are taking all the risk,"" Micheel said. ""It's time to consider 
some changes.""

Subject: California Action Update 1-14-00

Enron has agreed that the key issue is to focus on solving the S-T buying 
needs.  Attached is a spreadsheet that outlines the $ magnitude of the next 
few months.

TALKING POINTS:

Lot's of questions about DWR becoming the  vehicle for S-T buying and there 
is a significant legal risk for it becoming the vehicle.  WE DO NEED 
SOMETHING TO BRIDGE BEFORE WE PUT IN L-T CONTRACTS.
Huge and growing shortfall ($3.2B through March 31, 2001) 
The SOONER YOU CAN PUT IN L-T CONTRACTS STOP THE BLEEDING.
Bankruptcy takes all authority out of the Legislature's hands.

ACTION ITEMS:

1. Energy Sales Participation Agreement During Bankruptcy

Michael Tribolet will be contacting John Klauberg to discuss how to organize 
a Participation Agreement to sell to UDCs in Bankruptcy while securing Super 
Priority.

2. Legislative Language for CDWR (?) Buying Short-Term

Sandi McCubbin / Jeff Dasovich will lead team to offer new language to meet 
S-T requirements of UDCs.  Key is to talk with State of California Treasurer 
to see if the $ can be found or provided to private firms.  ($3.5B by end of 
April).  Pat Boylston will develop ""public benefit"" language for options 
working with Mike Day.  He can be reached at 503-294-9116 or 
pgboylston@stoel.com.

3. Get Team to Sacramento

Get with Hertzberg to discuss the options (Bev Hansen).  Explain the 
magnitude of the problem.  Get Mike Day to help draft language.  

4. See if UDCs have any Thoughts

Steve Kean will communicate with UDCs to see if they have any solutions or 
thougths.  Probably of limited value.

5. Update List

Any new information on this should be communicated to the following people as 
soon as possible.  These people should update their respective business units.

Phillip"
522,allen-p,"George,

Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders 
profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be 
recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would 
be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.



Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the 
investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned 
earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as 
part of the construction contract.  

Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look 
like here are a few ideas:

 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from 
higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.

 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 
1 complete in November)
      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule
      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule

This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but 
could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule 
must be discussed and agreed upon.

Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626

Here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages.  There 
are alot of overages.  It will probably get worse this month because of all 
the cold weather.

You need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap.  
This needs to be handwritten on all new leases.

I am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet.  We 
also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need 
to conserve energy if they don't want to exceed their cap.  I will write 
something today.

 Utility overages for #26 and #44?  Where did you get these amounts?  For 
what periods?

 
What is going on with #42.   Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!!  
That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money 
and time remodeling.  I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first 
asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like 
leaky pipes.  If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the 
apartment and charge them for the labor.  Then we will perform monthly 
inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property.  This tenant has 
been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off.

I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so 
I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank.  Is this 
right?  Has the deposit been made yet?

Subject: Meeting with Governor Davis, need for additional comments/suggestions

We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA.  In attendance were Ken Lay, 
the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. 
spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his 
ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next 
week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.  
Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on 
my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff 
Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our 
proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation 
based on the governor's comments:

Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that 
we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing 
communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to 
go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what 
the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more 
work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He 
talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail 
level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the 
benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he 
would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power 
(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented 
solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix 
the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.
Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also 
included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed 
interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a 
goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities 
to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate 
analysts and other ""nonadvocates"" to develop solutions to a number of issues 
including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  
He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas 
purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding 
some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.
His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously 
under serious consideration and some of which were mere ""brainstorming"".  
Some of these ideas would require legislative action.
State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a ""couple"" of 
generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that 
they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This 
was a frequently recurring theme.
Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus 
basis to consumers.
Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in 
California.
State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more 
widely deploy distributed generation.
Expand in-state gas production.
Take state lands gas royalties in kind.
negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for 
addtional gas supplies.
Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant 
maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at 
any one time.
Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.
Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear 
more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be 
able to help out here).
Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made 
some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy 
some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation 
thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control 
approach with generators.
Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.
To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's 
thoughts and get them to Kari)
He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- 
not just the 5 one year strips.
He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.
He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the 
deal.
He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the 
forward contracting issues.
Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today."

described to you last week.  The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in 
San Marcos.  There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a 
couple of other investors involved.  As I mentioned last week, I would like 
to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not 
require the investors to personally guarantee.  If there is a creative way to 
structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.  One idea that has 
been mentioned is to obtain a ""forward commitment"" in order to reduce the 
equity required.  I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this 
nature are normally financed.  Specifically, the transition from interim to 
permanent financing.  I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be 
important to banks. 

 I am faxing you a project summary.  And I will have the builder/developer 
email or fax his financial statement to you.

 Let me know what else you need.  The land is scheduled to close mid January.


Phillip Allen"
537,allen-p,"Jeff,

Everything should be done for closing on the Leander deal on the 29th.  I 
have fed ex'd the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out 
tomorrow.    When will more money be required?  Escrow for roads?  Utility 
connections?  Other rezoning costs?  

What about property taxes?  The burnet land lost its ag exemption while I 
owned it.  Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this 
property?  Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes 
once the property is rezoned?  Do we need to find a farmer and give him 
grazing rights?

What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and 
annexing?  I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and 
American Multifamily walking on this deal.  So I just want to make sure we 
are pushing the process as fast as we can.

Phillip"
538,allen-p,"Steve,


I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.  If 
you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.









As far as recommendations, here is a short list:

 1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales 
above monthly index without enough consideration of future 
      replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be 
injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.
                    This creates a shortage in later months.

 2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet 
demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.  
                      Specific questions should include:  

  1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order 
to fill storage?

  2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too 
much gas from Socal's system.  
       I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their 
own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than 
their injection capablity, but injected far less.

 3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short 
term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major 
                    LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating 
rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market 
and the 
     consumer has benefitted.  


Call me if you need any more input.

 Here is a rentroll for this week.  The one you sent for 11/24 looked good.  
It seems like most people are paying on time.  Did you rent an efficiency to 
the elderly woman on a fixed income?  Go ahead a use your judgement on the 
rent prices for the vacant units.  If you need to lower the rent by $10 or 
$20 to get things full, go ahead.

Enclosed is the cost breakdown for the appraiser.  Note that the
construction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our
standard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio
of 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.

Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs
are high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have
actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf
without overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.

It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairly
sure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.

I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are
$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3
bedroom.  Additional revenues could be generated by building detached
garages, which would rent for $50-75 per month.

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack=
 of Support
Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the=
 bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a=
 deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republic=
ans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic cauc=
us is reportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republic=
ans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, o=
nce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double=
 dip"" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg=
islature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses th=
e details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take plac=
e.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the lon=
g-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require t=
hat the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in =
breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th=
e bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st wi=
ll be very difficult.

The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat=
e would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General=
 Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately =
$8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this =
concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for ful=
l disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the =
details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they=
 will support the bond issuance to go forward.

Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB =
31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bi=
ll passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac=
k of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs fo=
r community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be am=
ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, curre=
ntly in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should get =
paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be li=
kely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).=20
=20
According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republic=
ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in =
the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 =
of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republ=
icans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend=
 to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers repo=
rtedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind=
ications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.

Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time
The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create t=
he California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion=
 authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be aut=
horized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the addi=
tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power =
going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authoriz=
ations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor =
has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is =
that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No f=
urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it =
is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas=
ing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the Calif=
ornia Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be consi=
dered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earl=
ier in the crisis.
=20
SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy
At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  T=
he first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the =
governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au=
gust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According t=
o sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has s=
igned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi=
s and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicat=
es that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank=
ruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. =20

The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond is=
suance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) s=
tating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, th=
en the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the st=
ate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and p=
assed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for=
 bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and=
 the DWR proportionately from rate payments."

The back office is having a hard time dealing with the $11 million dollars 
that is to be recognized as transport expense by the west desk then recouped 
from the Office of the Chairman.    Is your understanding that the West desk 
will receive origination each month based on the schedule below.

 
 The Office of the Chairman agrees to grant origination to the Denver desk as 
follows:

October 2000  $1,395,000
November 2000 $1,350,000
December 2000 $1,395,000
January 2001  $   669,600
February 2001  $   604,800
March 2001  $   669,600
April 2001  $   648,000
May 2001  $   669,600
June 2001  $   648,000
July 2001  $   669,600
August 2001  $   669,600
September 2001 $   648,000
October 2001  $   669,600
November 2001 $   648,000
December 2001 $   669,600

This schedule represents a demand charge payable to NBP Energy Pipelines by 
the Denver desk.  The demand charge is $.18/MMBtu on 250,000 MMBtu/Day 
(Oct-00 thru Dec-00) and 120,000 MMBtu/Day (Jan-01 thru Dec-01).  The ENA 
Office of the Chairman has agreed to reimburse the west desk for this expense.

to a 41.67 heat rate.  We applied forward gas prices to historical loads.  I

Prices seem low.  Looks like November NP15 is trading above the cap based on

 The San Marcos project is sounding very attractive.  I have one other 
investor in addition to Keith that has interest.  Some additional background 
information on Larry and yourself would be helpful.

 Background Questions:
 
 Please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in 
Creekside.

 Please list projects completed during the last 5 years.  Include the project 
description, investors, business entity, 

 Please provide the names and numbers of prior investors.

 Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on 
recent projects.


 With regard to the proposed investment structure, I would suggest a couple 
of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between Creekside and the 
investors. 


 Preferable Investment Structure:

 Developers guarantee note, not investors.

 Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing.

 Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns.

         Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should 
tackle these issues now.  These questions are not intended to be offensive in 
any way.  It is my desire to build a successful project with Creekside that 
leads to future opportunities.  I  am happy to provide you with any 
information that you need to evaluate myself or Keith as a business partner.

to the west desk during that time.  She frequently came to work before 4 AM 
to prepare operations reports.  Patti worked 7 days a week during this time.  
If long hours were not enough, there was a pipeline explosion during this

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards
President, Creekside Builders, LLC

 Regarding Patti Sullivan's contributions to the west desk this year, her 
efforts deserve recognition and a PBR award.  Patti stepped up to fill the 
gap left by Randy Gay's personal leave.  Patti held together the scheduling 
group for about 2 month's by working 7days a week during this time.  Patti 
was always the first one in the office during this time.  Frequently, she 
would be at work before 4 AM to prepare the daily operation package.  All the 
traders came to depend on the information Patti provided.   This information 
has been extremely critical this year due to the pipeline explosion and size 
of the west desk positions.  
 Please call to discuss cash award.

Western Power Prices Fall With Warmer Weather, Natural Gas Loss

     Los Angeles, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Western spot
power prices declined today from a combination of warmer weather
across the region and declining natural gas prices.
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average about 2 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal for the next seven days. In the Southwest
temperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal.
     At the California-Oregon Border, heavy load power fell
$172.00 from yesterday to $430.00-$475.00.
     ""What happened to all of this bitter cold weather we were
supposed to have,'' said one Northwest power marketer. Since the
weather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower.""
     Temperatures in Los Angeles today will peak at 66 degrees,
and are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend.
     Natural gas to be delivered to the California Oregon from the
El Paso Pipeline traded between $20-$21, down $3 from yesterday.
     ""Gas prices are declining causing western daily power prices
to fall,'' said one Northwest power trader.
     At the NP-15 delivery point heavy load power decreased
$206.25 from yesterday to $325.00-$450.00. Light load energy fell
to $200.00-$350.00, falling $175.00 from yesterday.
     PSC of New Mexico's 498-megawatt San Juan Unit 4 coal plant
was shut down this morning for a tube leak. The unit is scheduled
to restart this weekend.
     At the Four Corners located in New Mexico, power traded at
$325.00-$335.00 plunging $182.50 from yesterday.

PJM Spot Power Prices Dip With Weather, Falling Natural Gas

     Philadelphia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak next-day
power prices declined at the western hub of the Pennsylvania-New
Jersey-Maryland Interconnection amid warmer weather forecasts and
falling natural gas prices, traders said.
     The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power at western
PJM declined an average of $12.75 a megawatt-hour, with trades
ranging from $62.00-$76.00.
     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.
forecast tomorrow's high temperature in Philadelphia at 40 degrees
Fahrenheit, up 7 degrees from today's expected high. Temperatures
could climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday.
     ""Most of the day's activity took place in the early part of
the morning,"" said one PJM-based trader. ""By options expiration
the market had pretty much dried up.""
     Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the main
reason for the decline in spot market prices.
     Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to the
New York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per million
British thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. Since
Monday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of
$2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecasts
indicated reduced utility load requirements.
     In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies they
normally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weather
forecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets.
     Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13
higher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the
$67.00-$75.00 range. Power at Zone J sold $7.50 higher at $90.00-
$92.00.

Mid-Continent Power Prices Drop on Revised Forecast, Gas Prices

     Cincinnati, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continent
next-day peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revised
warmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said.
     The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power on the
Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system dropped $23.19
to $67.90 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $75.00 as the
market opened down to $59.00 after options expired.
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power on
the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison Co. grid sold $21.37 lower
on average at $60.00-$75.00, while power in lower MAIN sold $18.17
lower at $65.00-$100.00.
     Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc. predicted
high temperatures would average 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal
in Chicago and at normal levels in Cincinnati over the next seven
days, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal Monday, respectively.
     Traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulled
prices down. Natural gas prices were a large factor in recent
electricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-fired
generation to meet increased weather-related demand.
     Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an average
of 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million British
thermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an average
of 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu.
     ""The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've got
people coming to their senses,"" one trader said. ""These are much
more realistic prices.""
     Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if the
outlook for weather continues to be mild. Peak Cinergy power for
delivery from Dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00
yesterday.
     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices plunged
with warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmission
capacity, selling $37.67 less in northern MAPP and $44.17 less in
southern MAPP at $75.00-$125.00.
     ""What's happening is the people who don't have firm
transmission are getting into the market early and buying at those
high prices since they have no choice,"" one MAPP trader said.
     ""Then you've got some people who were lucky enough to get a
firm path who waited until later in the morning when ComEd prices
fell off,"" he said, ""and bought from them at those lower prices,
causing the huge gap between the day's high and low trade.""

Southeast U.S. Electricity Prices Slump After Mild Forecast

     Atlanta, Georgia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Southeast
U.S. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather was
forecast for the region this week, traders said.
     Traders said Southeast utility demand has been reduced since
many large population centers like Atlanta will see temperatures
climb into the mid-50s Fahrenheit later this week.
     ""There was nothing going on in Florida today,"" said one
southern energy trader. ""Everything was going to markets in the
north.""
     Traders said supply was being routed from Florida into
markets on the Entergy Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority
grid in the mid-$70s a megawatt-hour.
     ""Prices into TVA started in the $80s and $90s and crumbled as
forecasts came out,"" said on Entergy power trader. ""Prices,
declined to $60 and less.""
     The Bloomberg into TVA index price fell an average of $23.95
to $70.25 amid trades in the $65.00-$80.00 range. Off-peak trades
were noted at $32.00, several dollars higher than recent
estimates.
     Southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weather
forecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week
caused prices to decline in the region.
     In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather was
the main culprit behind lower prices.
     ""The cold weather's backing off,"" said one SPP utility
trader. ""It was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday and
today it's about 9 degrees with the wind chill.  Yesterday, it was
bitter cold and today it was just plain cold.""
     Power sold in northern sections of SPP at $78-$100, though
the Bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to $88.00. Southern
SPP traded at $82.00, $2 more than yesterday.

U.K. Day-Ahead Electricity Prices Rise Amid Increased Demand

     London, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity prices in
the U.K. rose today after falling temperatures were expected to
increase household consumption for space heating, traders said.
     The day-ahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by the
Electricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01
pounds a megawatt-hour.
     Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degrees
to 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather Services
Corp. in the U.S.
     Day-ahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15
pounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday.
     December continued to fall amid a combination of position
closing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will
not rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said.
     December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds a
megawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday's last trade.
     First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with
expectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue
to stifle demand, traders said.
     January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds a
megawatt-hour, falling 17 pence.
     First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds a
megawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close.
     Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer
2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour.
Winter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a
megawatt-hour.
     Open positions on many short-term structures will likely
force many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run-
up to Christmas, traders said. Adding that other structures will
probably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more
easily be assessed.

Nordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast

     Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices
on the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher today
as colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said.
     Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt-
hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday's closing trade on 1,076
megawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446
megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede after
forecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia for
next week. These producers typically generate power to prevent
reservoirs from overflowing.
     Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise
with falling temperatures because of increased requirements for
space heating.
     Traded volume on the power exchange increased in active
trading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders
said.
     ""The market's been waiting for this day for a long time,"" a
Stockholm-based trader said. ""For too long, people have been
selling because winter hasn't lived up to expectations. We should
now see a noticeable increase in the spot price.""
     Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fall
below freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limited
chances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to Weather
Services Corp. in the U.S.
     The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand was
expected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict
temperatures to begin falling.
     Thursday's system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22
percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell
4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts.
     Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise
by 10-15 kroner by the start of next week.
     Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter-
term contracts.
     Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour,
1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner a
megawatt-hour.
     Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, although
expected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producers
to meet the increased demand, other traders said.
     Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor,
will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said.
     Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used
today's news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list

Phillip,
 Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, 
on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic 
consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time 
consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the 
inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can 
arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the 
future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 
The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to 
themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this 
project.

I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now 
we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list


From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated 
positions, I think we still have the following issues:
We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had 
three meetings which brought out very different issues from different 
traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader 
requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.
We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to 
be outside the scope of position consolidation.

Things left to do:
I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to 
make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this 
project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.
Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this 
project and which fall out of scope.
For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and 
work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.
Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all 
drill downs.
Use the above to formulate a project plan.

Things requested thus far (no particular order):
Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal 
ticker.
Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that 
add up existing position manager rows/columns).
New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, 
transport, swaps, options, ...
Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values 
of all curves on which the desk has a position.
Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be 
shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid 
would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.
Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the 
appropriate positions to show for each:
Gas Daily for monthly index,
Physical gas for Nymex,
Physical gas for Inside Ferc,
Physical gas for Mid market.
Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of 
using official valuations.
Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.
Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:
Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility 
skew and correlations.
Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  
Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a 
gamma grid.
Valuation of Gas Daily options.
A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.
Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.
Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position 
manager.
Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, 
prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.
Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.
Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of 
individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.
Benchmark positions in TDS.
Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit 
and explicit position break out issues.

-- Allan.

PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for 
transport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that 
point."

Westgate

Enclosed are demographics on the Westgate site from Investor's Alliance.
Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package
on San Marcos that you received earlier.
If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know.
Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project?

San Marcos
The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for
sale and approved for 134 units.  The land is selling for $2.50 per square
foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West
San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.

Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes
and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25
per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and
$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This
property will have the best location for student housing of all new
projects, just as the duplexes do now.

If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there
is a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not
yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will
know more on this question later today.

Liane,

 As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt to 
manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  It appears that a single 
buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above 
market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades, 
offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were 
bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index 
calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated 
financial swaps for San Juan.

 We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from 
September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from 
Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage 
firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a 
trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas 
daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread 
relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:

 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater 
than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 

 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & 
Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and 
       October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that 
are dramatically different.


 I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the 
trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to 
determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are 
outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in 
establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at 
$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the 
calculation of index.

 It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to 
conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me 
anytime I can assist you towards this goal.

Sincerely,

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards
President, Creekside Builders, LLC

Subject: closing



Jeff, 
?
Is the closing today?? After reviewing the  agreement?I find it isn't binding 
as far as I can determine.? It is  too vague and it doesn't sound like 
anything an attorney or title company  would?draft for a real estate 
closing--but, of course, I could be  wrong.? 
?
If this?closing is going to take place without  this agreement then there is 
no point in me  following up on this?document's validity.? 
?
I will just need to go back to my closing documents  and see what's there and 
find out where I am with that and deal with this as  best I can.
?
I guess I was expecting something that would be an  exhibit to a recordable 
document or something a little more exact, or  rather?sort of a contract.? 
This isn't either.? I tried to get a  real estate atty on the phone last 
night but he was out of pocket.? I  talked to a crim. atty friend and he said 
this is out of his area but doesn't  sound binding to him.? 
?
I will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's  transaction?and take a look at 
that but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature? is even 
needed to complete this transaction.?  I am in after 12 noon if there is any 
need to contact me regarding the  closing.
?
I really do not want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myself 
and I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn't 
seem to be something required for a closing.? In  the event you do need my 
signature on something like this I would rather have  time to have it 
reviewed before I accept it.
?

Phillip"
630,allen-p,"George,

 Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate 
project:

 Ownership Structure

 What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner?

 What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what 
capacity(regarding ownership and 
 liabilities)?

 Who owns the land? improvements?

 Who holds the various loans?

 Is the land collateral?

 Investment
 
 What happens to initial investment?

 Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?
 
 Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?

 When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment 
schedule?

 Investment Return

 Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?

 Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits 
are distributed?

 Debt

 Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral 
is associated with each 
 loan?

 Improvement

 Construction

 Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.

 Terms of each loan?

 Uses of Funds

 How will disbursements be made?  By whom?

 What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing 
for investors?

 Reports to track expenses vs plan?

 Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?

 What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get 
paid a markup on subcontractors as a 
 general contractor and paid gain out of profits?

 Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses 
before the ultimate payout of profits?

 Design and Construction
 
 When will design be complete?

 What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?

 What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction 
planning and permitting?

 Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, 
vendors, and other professionals? 
 Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?

 Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to 
use? Names?

These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor 
in a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn as
much as possible from the process.

Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls


Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

632,allen-p,"George,

 Here sales numbers from Reagan:

 
 

 As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The 
1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the 
units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units 
under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with 
competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals 
actually done to date.   

 Let me know what you think.  I will follow up with an email and phone call 
about Cherry Creek.  I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was 
rejected on the De Ville property.

 I checked my records and I mailed check #1178 for the normal amount on

I was aware that Regan Lehman, the lot developer for the entire 70 lot
duplex project, was selling his units in the $180's,  He does have a much
lower basis in the lots than anyone else, but the prime differences are due
to a) he is selling them during construction and b) they are smaller units.
We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of
the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan.  This would produce an average sq
footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his
sales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell
for $203,108.
What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the
rent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own
evaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the
3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we
were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom
units along with the 3-bedroom plan.
Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.

Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls


Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

 Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development 
opportunities.

 I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were 
built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for 
 around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated 
that he had more units under construction that would be 
 available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different 
from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor
 plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.  

 As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.  

 Call or email with your thoughts.

Do not underestimate the effects of the Internet economy on load growth.  I 
have been preaching the tremendous growth described below for the last year.  
The utility infrastructure simply cannot handle these loads at the 
distribution level and ultimatley distributed generation will be required for 
power quality reasons.

The City of Austin, TX has experienced 300+ MW of load growth this year due 
to server farms and technology companies.  There is a 100 MW server farm 
trying to hook up to HL&P as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 months 
due to distribution infrastructure issues.  Obviously, Seattle, Porltand, 
Boise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rude 
awakening in the next 2-3 years.

Internet Data Gain Is a Major Power Drain on
                  Local Utilities 

                  ( September 05, 2000 ) 


                  In 1997, a little-known Silicon Valley company called Exodus
                  Communications opened a 15,000-square-foot data center in 
Tukwila. 

                       The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and 
computer servers for the
                  region's growing number of dot-coms. 

                       Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up 
construction
                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than 
a mile from its
                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several 
fiber optic backbones, the
                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and 
eventually
                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, 
Microsoft and Onvia.com. 

                       Exodus is not the only company building massive data 
centers near Seattle.
                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, 
Globix and
                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house 
the networking
                  equipment of the Internet economy. 

                       It is a big business that could have an effect on 
everything from your
                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access 
your favorite Web sites.

                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and 
server farms, are
                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent 
Valley that some
                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and 
Puget Sound
                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, 
high-security
                  facilities. 

                       ""We are talking to about half a dozen customers that 
are requesting 445
                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,"" 
said Karl
                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound 
Energy. ""That is
                  the equivalent of six oil refineries."" 

                       A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, 
the rise of the Internet
                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their 
heads. 

                       Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington 
Utilities and
                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new 
data centers. The
                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing 
residential and business
                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations 
necessary to support
                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 
million each,
                  Karzmar said. 

                       Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to 
bring up the data center
                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. 

                       For the utilities that provide power to homes, 
businesses and schools in the
                  region, this is a new and complex issue. 

                       On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing 
appetite for power --
                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The 
facilities run 24 hours a
                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a 
constant revenue
                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that 
they could
                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital 
expenditures. 

                       Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will 
mean for power rates
                  in the area is still open to debate. 

                       ""These facilities are what we call extremely dense 
loads,"" said Bob Royer,
                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle 
City Light. 

                       ""The entire University of Washington, from stadium 
lights at the football
                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. 
We have data
                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 
and 50 megawatts."" 

                       With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate 
complex in Tukwila is
                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased 
the 1.35 million
                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from 
Boeing Space &
                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 
92 percent of the
                  six-building complex to seven different co-location 
companies. 

                       ""It is probably the largest data center park in the 
country,"" boasts Laurent
                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG 
Communications,
                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama 
Networks all
                  lease space in the office park. 

                       After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, 
Sabey has become an
                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under 
management or
                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole 
claims his firm is
                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in 
the country. 

                       As more people access the Internet and conduct 
bandwidth-heavy tasks
                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for 
co-location space in
                  Seattle continues to escalate. 

                       But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center 
space is growing at a
                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, 
causing similar
                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and 
California. 

                       Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location 
space, plans to nearly
                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. 
While companies
                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many 
high-tech companies
                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such 
as Exodus that
                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic 
management. 

                       ""We have 2 million square feet of space under 
construction and we plan to
                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more 
demand right now
                  than data center space,"" said Steve Porter, an account 
executive at Exodus in
                  Seattle. 

                       The booming market for co-location space has left some 
in the local utility
                  industry perplexed. 

                       ""It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do 
to serve the growth,""
                  said Seattle City Light's Royer. ""The utility industry is 
almost stunned by this, in
                  a way."""

Hi Phillip.  We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team
Selection information.

Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form
we sent you.  The information needed is then easily transferred into the
database directly from that Excel spreadsheet.  If you do not have the
ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still
require additional information.

We need each person's email address.  Without the email address, we cannot
email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can
we send them an automatic reminder via email.  It would also be good to have
each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.

So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need
to instead, provide the needed information via email.

Thank you for your assistance Phillip.

 Compare your california production to the numbers in the 2000 California Gas

Subject: Receipt of Team Selection Form - Executive Impact & Influence Program


Hi Phillip.  We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team
Selection information.

Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form
we sent you.  The information needed is then easily transferred into the
database directly from that Excel spreadsheet.  If you do not have the
ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still
require additional information.

We need each person's email address.  Without the email address, we cannot
email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can
we send them an automatic reminder via email.  It would also be good to have
each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.

So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need
to instead, provide the needed information via email.

Thank you for your assistance Phillip.

Keith"
666,allen-p,Why are his requests coming to me?
667,allen-p,"Phillip -- Is the value axis on Sheet 2 of the ""socalprices"" spread sheet 
supposed to be in $?  If so, are they the right values (millions?) and where 
did they come from?  I can't relate them to the Sheet 1 spread sheet.

As I told Mike, we will file this out-of-time tomorrow as a supplement to our 
comments today along with a cover letter.  We have to fully understand the 
charts and how they are constructed, and we ran out of time today.  It's much 
better to file an out-of-time supplement to timely comments than to file the 
whole thing late, particuarly since this is apparently on such a fast track.

Thanks.

 Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal 
basis and socal/san juan spreads.  I listed the days during bidweek that 
reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints 
before and after bidweek.  



 




 The following observations can be made:

  July 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs 
actual of .79
   2.  Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91
   3.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

  Aug. 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs 
actual of .99
   2.  Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49
   3.  Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the 
monthly postings
   4.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

   

 Enron Online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against 
the index, as well as, spreads to other locations.  Please call with any 
questions.

Phillip"

 On another note, do you have any idea how Patti is holding up?

Phillip"
676,allen-p,"Brad,

 With regard to Tori Kuykendall, I would like to promote her to commercial 
manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an 
associate.  Her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a 
commercial manager.  I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to 
others in that category at year end.  

 Martin Cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as Tori.  
Hunter would like Martin handled the same as Tori.

 Let me know if there are any issues.

 The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better.  See if you can add 
these modifications:

 1.  Use a formula in column E.  Add the value in column C to column D.  It 
should read =c6+d6.  Then copy this formula to the rows below.

 2.  Column H needs a formula.  Subtract amount paid from amount owed.  
=e6-g6.

 3.  Column F is filled with the #### sign.  this is because the column width 
is too narrow.  Use you mouse to click on the line beside the 
       letter F.  Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.

 4.  After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to 
this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond.

Phillip"
680,allen-p,"Lucy,
 I got your email with the attachment.  Let's work together today to get this 
done

Phillip"
681,allen-p,you have my approval
682,allen-p,"Lucy,

 We can discuss your email later.  How is progress on creating the 
spreadsheets.  You will probably need to close the file before you attach to 
an email.  It is 2:00.  I really want to make some progress on these two 
files.

Phillip"
683,allen-p,"Lucy,

Please open this excel file and input the rents and names due for this week.  
Then email the file back."
684,allen-p,"Open the ""utility"" spreadsheet and try to complete the analysis of whether it 
is better to be a small commercial or a medium commercial (LP-1).
You will need to get the usage for that meter for the last 12 months.  If we 
have one year of data, we can tell which will be cheaper.  Use the rates 
described in the spreadsheet.  This is a great chance for you to practice 
excel."
685,allen-p,"Mac,

 Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:

  Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year
  
  Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf

  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 

   Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:
  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS 
X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share


 That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think 
crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.

 Current price 37
 Nat. Gas 34
 Crude  10

 Total  81

 
 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this 
looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, 
Tosco, and SLB?


Thank you,

listen to different, people about what Mary is saying should i be worried?
ants seem to be invading my apartment.You got my other fax's Wade is working
on the bulletin board that I need up so that I can let tenants know about
what is going on.Gave #25 a notice about having to many people staying in
that apt and that problem has been resolved.Also I have a tenant in #29 that
is complaining about #28 using fowl language.I sent #28 a lease violation we
will see how that goes
                                                  call you tomorrow

Subject: TRANSPORTATION MODEL

Please plan to attend a meeting on Friday, August 11 at 11:15 a.m. in 30C1 to 
discuss the transportation model.  Now that we have had several traders 
managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss 
any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu 
(Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they 
will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this 
meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is 
comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those 
who are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have 
heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to 
discuss them.

Please let me know if you are unable to attend."

 First, I want to implement the following changes:

  1.  No Overtime without my written (or email) instructions.
  2.  Daily timesheets for you and Wade faxed to me daily
  3.  Paychecks will be issued each Friday by me at the State Bank
  4.  No more expenditures on office or landscape than is necessary for basic 
operations.


 Moving on to the checkbook, I have attached a spreadsheet that organizes all 
the checks since Jan. 1.
 When you open the file, go to the ""Checkbook"" tab and look at the yellow

Subject: Price for Stanfield Term

I am sending off a follow-up to a bid I submitted to Clark County PUD.  They 
have requested term pricing for Stanfield on a volume of 17,000.  Could you 
give me a basis for the period :

Sept -00 - May 31, 2006
Sept-00 - May 31, 2008

Since I assume you do not keep a Stanfield basis, but rather a basis off 
Malin or Rockies, it would probably make sense to show the basis as an 
adjustment to one of these point.  Also, what should the Mid - Offer Spread 
be on these terms.

Thanks, Mike"
720,allen-p,"Wade,

 I understood your number one priority was to deal with your vehicle 
situation.  You need to take care of it this week.  Lucy can't hold the 
tenants to a standard (vehicles must be in running order with valid stickers) 
if the staff doesn't live up to it.  If you decide to buy a small truck and 
you want to list me as an employer for credit purposes, I will vouch for your 
income.

Hey Phillip,
I received your note from Celeste.  I am the ENA Staffing Coordinator and 
need for you to fill out the attached Needs Assessment form before I can send 
you any resumes.  Also, would you be interested in the new class?  Analysts 
start with the business units on Aug. 3rd and Assoc. start on Aug. 28th.  We 
are starting to place the Associates and would like to see if you are 
interested.  Please let me know.  

Once I receive the Needs Assessment back (and you let me know if you can wait 
a month,) I will be happy to pull a couple of resumes for your review.  If 
you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

Subject: (Reminder) Update GIS Information

This is a reminder !!!  If you haven't taken the time to update your GIS 
information, please do so.  It is essential that this function be performed 
as soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days 
ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to 
call Ted Bland @ 3-5275.

With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees 
between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to 
have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee 
data.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the 
year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC 
requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their 
profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education 
need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is 
accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to 
hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com 
on the command line of your browser.

The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would 
like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned 
for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please 
contact Kathy Schultea at x33841.  

Your  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.   


Thanks,

Mark,

We are currently back-testing the storage model. 
The enclosed version contains deltas and decision 
variable. 

You mentioned that you have resources to run the model. Please do so.
This will help us to gain experience with the market vs the
model.

I am going to distribute an article by Caminus, an software vendor.
The article illustrates the optionality associated with storage operation
very well.  The Enron Research storage model  is a lot like that, although 
implementation may be
different.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

 I emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company.  I think 
I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from 
him.  Basically, they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some 
price that undercuts the current provider.  Then once their sales are large 
enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit.  
The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage 
the price risk.  This is my best guess.  I will get back to you with more.

Subject: Thoughts on Presentation

It is a shame that the CAISO doesn't provide actual generation by unit.  The 
WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, 
which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes 
the CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but 
there can be a siginificant difference between ""scheduled"" and ""actual"" 
generation.  You are pulling ""scheduled.""  If someone doesn't schedule their 
generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you 
will miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california 
munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, 
if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply 
schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said 
all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on 
the generation side.

On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While 
they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is 
better than the ""scheduled"" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the 
load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.

I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with 
others up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas 
demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, 
especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the 
UEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginal 
consumer then it is obviously a different story.

Let's talk."

Subject: Transport p&l

Phillip--
I've noticed one thing on your intra-month transport p&l that looks strange 
to me.  Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be 
an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is 
O.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to 
get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and 
I'll take care of it..

On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate 
curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of 
$235,019.   
(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your 
overall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects 
something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal 
#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.
  139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)
  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)
  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)
  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)
  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)
 Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to 
GDP-Kingsgate.

 Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five 
different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for 
withdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a 
Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is 
that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport 
losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  
I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a 
systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems 
that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, 
the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the 
detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it 
appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be 
an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar 
impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in 
case there's something you want to do about it.  The columns below show the 
volumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each.

Mike McDonald and I met with SW Gas this morning.  They were polite regarding 
asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to 
listen to a proposal.  However, they are very interested in weather hedges to 
protect throughput related earnings.  We are pursuing a confidentiality 
agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable 
us to develop proposals.  Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder 
value by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and by 
reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a 
weather product.

As to your other question.  We have yet to identify or pursue other 
candidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy 
to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our 
opportunities.  We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as we 
implement our strategy in California.

Are there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset 
management deal that we should approach?  Otherwise, we intend to 
systematically identify and work through all the candidates.

Janie,

Thanks for the fax on SW Gas.

We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to 
discuss asset management.  In preparation for that meeting we would like to 
gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  
Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are 
typical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  
How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main 
contacts at SW Gas?

We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our 
control of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably 
have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the 
commissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their 
commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) 
should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month 
index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That 
risk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of 
their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.

As to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are 
there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly 
appreciated.

Thanks for remembering my birthday.  You beat my parents by one day.  

The family is doing fine.  Grace is really smiling.  She is a very happy baby 
as long as she is being held.

It sounds like your house is coming along fast.  I think my folks are ready 
to start building.  

We will probably visit in late June or July.  May is busy.  We are taking the 
kids to Disney for their birthdays.

Good luck on the house.

Subject: REVISION - - LOAD AND RESOURCE ESTIMATES


Most control areas have now reported the amount of load relief and generation 
increase that was experienced over the Peak period (17:00-18:00 PST) on 
December 12.  The data I have received thus far are summarized in the 
following paragraphs.

The approximate amount of load relief achieved due to conservation or 
curtailments over the Peak period on December 12 was 835 MWh.

The approximate amount of generation increase due to extraordinary operations 
or purchases over the Peak period on December 12 was 786 MWh.

A note of caution, these figures are very imprecise and were derived with a 
lot of guesswork.  However, they should be within the ballpark of reality.

Why am I not surprised ?

I suspect that if someone were to build a town called Lime, make
everything in the town out of lime, provide only foods that have
some connection to lime and then bury the Limeys in lime when
they're dead, 'Arry would move to that town in a flash and think
that he had arrived in Paradise on Earth.

According to my v-a-a-a-ast network of spies, sneaks and sleuths,
this next issue of The Last Straw focusses on lime... and to no one's
surprise, will feature some of the musings/wisdom/experience of our
Master of Lime, 'Arry .

Those same spies/sneaks/sleuths tell me that the format of this
next issue is a departure from the norm and may be a Beeg Surprise
to some.

Me ?  My curiosity is piqued and am itchin' to see this Limey
issue of The Last Straw and if you are afflicted with the same and
do not yet subscribe, it may not be too late:

 thelaststraw@strawhomes.com
or www.strawhomes.com

839,allen-p,"Folks,

I just found this interesting site about the history of the uses of lime and
development of pozzolonic materials ...lime and clay - Roman Cement -  that I
think will be interesting to the group.

I highly recommend David Moore's book ""The Roman Pantheon"" at $25.00  -   a
very thorough research into the uses and development of Roman Cement....lime
and clay/pozzolonic ash; the making and uses of lime in building. The book
covers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete.

I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily -
interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 years
learning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings,
structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash -  structures that have
lasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good
background information for sustainable builder folks.

Thank you, Mr. Moore. I highly recommend the site and especially the Book.

Phillip -
I applaud you for using your cycle as daily transportation.  Saves on gas, 
pollution and helps keep you strong and healthy.  Enron provides bike racks 
in the front of the building for requests such as this.  Phillip, I wish we 
could accommodate this request; however, The Body Shop does not have the 
capacity nor can assume the responsibility for storing cycles on a daily 
basis.  If you bring a very good lock you should be able to secure the bike 
at the designated outside racks.

There are a number of excellent sites for radiant heating, including the
magazine fine homebuilding June-July 1992 issue: the Radiant Panel
Association;  ASHRAE  Chapter 6;   Radiantec-Radiant heating system from
Radiantec;  the following web site:  http://www.twapanels.ca/heating
index.html

The above is a good start, and each of the sites have a number of good
links.  Let me know how you make out in your search."

First one's free. So are the next thousand.

You know it's true: Video games are addictive. Sure, we could
trap you with a free game of Centipede, then kick up the price
after you're hooked. But that's not how shockwave.com operates.
Shockmachine -- the greatest thing since needle exchange -- is
now free; so are the classic arcade games. Who needs quarters?
Get Arcade Classics from shockwave.com, stick 'em in your
Shockmachine and then play them offline anytime you want.

Lick the Frog.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You're not getting a date this Friday night. But you don't care.
You've got a date with Frogger. This frog won't turn into a handsome
prince(ss), but it's sure to bring back great memories of hopping
through the arcade -- and this time, you can save your quarters for
laundry. Which might increase your potential for a date on Saturday.

Business Meeting or Missile Command? You Decide.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Take it offline! No, it's not a horrible meeting with your boss -
it's Missile Command. Shockmachine has a beautiful feature: you can
play without being hooked to the Internet. Grab the game from
shockwave.com, save it to your hard drive, and play offline! The
missiles are falling. Are you ready to save the world?

""I Want to Take You Higher!""
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Wanna get high? Here's your chance to do it at home - Shockmachine
lets you play your favorite arcade games straight from your computer.
It's a chance to crack your old high score. Get higher on Centipede -
get these bugs off me!

Souls for Sale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The '80s may not have left many good memories, but at least we still
have our Atari machines. What? You sold yours for a set of golf
clubs? Get your soul back, man! Super Breakout is alive and well and
waiting for you on Shockmachine. Now if you can just find that record
player and a Loverboy album...
http://shockwave1.m0.net/m/s.asp?H430297053X351633

Playing Arcade Classics on your Shockmachine -- the easiest way to
remember the days when you didn't have to work. If you haven't
already, get your free machine now.

879,allen-p,"Naomi,

The two analysts that I have had contact with are Matt Lenhart  and Vishal 
Apte.
Matt will be represented by Jeff Shankman.
Vishal joined our group in October.  He was in the Power Trading Group for 
the first 9 months.
I spoke to Jim Fallon and we agreed that he should be in the excellent 
category.  I just don't want Vishal 
to go unrepresented since he changed groups mid year.

Call me with questions.(x37041)

Western Power Spot Prices Sink Amid Weather-Related Demand

     Los Angeles, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Most Western U.S.
spot power prices for delivery tomorrow slumped as supply
outstripped demand.
     At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak
power dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt-
hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range.
     ""Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causing
prices to decline,"" said one Southwest trader.
     According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington
Massachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach
75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight.
     At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank
$202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 as
traders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range.
     Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawatt
Palo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increased
production to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of a
scheduled refueling outage that began March 31.
     At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power
slumped 47.5 percent from Friday's Sunday-Monday package to a
Bloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00.
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with cooling
demand 84 percent below normal.
     ""We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which is
causing temperatures to drop,"" said one Northwest trader.
     At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peak
power fell $189.39 to a Bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at
$175.00-$228.00.
     According the California Independent System Operator today's
forecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743
megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts.

Northeast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand

     Philadelphia, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- An increase in
available generation coupled with less weather-related demand,
caused next-day power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as much
as 11.3 percent this morning, traders said.
     According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,
temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree
Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and
cooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively.
     In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak
power scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg
volume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 from
Friday.
     ""There's just no weather out there,"" said one PJM-based
trader. ""There's no need for air conditioning, and no need for
heating. As far as I can tell, it's going to be that way all week
long.""
     Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000
megawatts through Friday.
     Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause for
the dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned to
service today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected to
hit the grid tomorrow.
     Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New York
Power Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2
nuclear power facilities.
     The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1
at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion of
a refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 at
full power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are owned
and operated by Niagara Mohawk.
     Zone J, which comprises New York City, slipped $4.50 to
$58.50, while Zones G and A fell $3.25 and $5.50, respectively, to
$51.25 and $40.00 indices.

Weather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up

     Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peak
power prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as high
weather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast,
traders said.
     ""It's supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA (Tennessee
Valley Authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergy
to there,"" one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said.
""Dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because of
that.""
     The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesday
into the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose
$3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25
when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired.
     Cinergy power for Wednesday-Friday delivery sold at $39.00
and power for May 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from the
Southeast was expected to remain high into next week.
     Next-day power in TVA sold $2.15 higher on average at
$28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee,
forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday.
     ""Things should continue along these lines for the rest of
the week, because there's enough power to get down there but not
so much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices,"" an
ECAR trader said.
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, demand from
the Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up,
though traders said transmission problems limited volume.
     Peak Monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at the
Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50,
and $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, with
trades from $32.00-$40.00.
     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices also
climbed today, showing the largest increase in the region as
above-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problems
isolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs.
     For-Tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northern
MAPP at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southern
half of the region at $45.00-$52.00.
     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.
predicted tomorrow's high temperature would be 85 degrees in
Minneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska.
     ""There's no available transmission from ComEd, and problems
getting power out of Ameren's grid too,"" one MAPP trader said.
""It's likely to cause problems all week, since it's hot here and
down in SPP (the Southwest Power Pool).""

Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up

     Atlanta, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot
electricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned to
major Southern U.S. population centers, traders said.
     Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather
Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta
vicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5
degrees higher than today's projected high. Cooler weather is
expected to begin Wednesday.
     Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity,
temperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week,
propelling air conditioning demand, traders said.
      The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council
regional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour from
equivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to $37.20.
Trades ranged from $26.50-$42.50.
     On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded an
average of $2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of $34.44 amid
trades in the $28.00-$37.00 range.
     In Texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firm
energy to a Bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traders
complained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000.
     ""There's just no overnight load to do anything with the
supply we have,"" said one Texas-based utility power trader.
""Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree
(Fahrenheit) days. This year so far, the highest we've seen is
85 degrees, so that's about 10 degrees below normal for us.""
     On the Entergy Corp. grid, day-ahead peak power for
tomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00, though most trades were done
at a Bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than Friday. Traders
said forecasts for cooler weather through much of the South
starting Wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at
$35-$36.
     Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing day-ahead energy
at $37 from utilities in the Virginia-Carolinas region because
power from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC.
     Southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a Bloomberg
index of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range.
     In the forward power markets, Entergy power for the
balance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though later
trades were noted as high as $48.75. Balance-of-May Entergy
power was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traders
said.
     On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week was
bid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45. Firm energy for
the balance of May was discussed at $41, though no new trades
were noted.

U.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids

     London, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K.
fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy selling
interest, traders said.
     Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds a
megawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, before
closing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower than
Friday.
     The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start of
the month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from one
trading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it was
short. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from opposition
from another trading house, which bought the contract, supporting
price levels, traders said.
     Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather was
expected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower production
costs because of falling natural gas prices, traders said.
     June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday after
last trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour.
     On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gas
futures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15
pence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence since
the start of last week.
     Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamental
reasons for price movements because of the immaturity of the
market, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements.
Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels,
they said.

Nordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest

     Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-term
electricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker,
Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushed
to buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amid
limited hydro-supply, traders said.
     Winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an all
time high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00
megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.
Winter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50-
214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     ""The market crash everyone was waiting for never came; now
you have to pay higher prices to develop positions,'' an Oslo-
based trader said. ""I'm surprised that even at the peak of the
snow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices are
steadily climbing.''
     Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percent
above normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters.
Still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a ""more
realistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wet
outlooks.''
     Tuesday's system area average price was set below expecations
of 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour,
down 7.45 kroner from today's price. Still, traders said this was
a ""high'' spot price for this time of the year.
     Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hour
with 140 megawatts exchanged.
     Trade volumes on Nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatt-hours
generation, up 368 percent from Friday's 1,169 gigawatt-hours.

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack 
of Support
Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the 
bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a 
deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans 
and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is 
reportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and 
Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the 
bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double dip"" into 
the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and 
the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of 
the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  
Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term 
power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the 
bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of 
contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge 
loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very 
difficult.

The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state 
would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General 
Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 
billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this 
concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full 
disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the 
details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they 
will support the bond issuance to go forward.

Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB 
31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill 
passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of 
Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for 
community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be 
amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, 
currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should 
get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be 
likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). 
 
According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, 
Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money 
available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated 
that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  
Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The 
Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, 
Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and 
there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.
 
Key Points of the Bridge Financing
Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B
Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B
   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B
   Bear Stearns  $625 M
Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt
Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%
   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%
Current Projected 
Blended IR:  5.38%
Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001
For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510

Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time
The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the 
California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion 
authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be 
authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the 
additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing 
power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these 
authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the 
governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond 
amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to 
support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 
6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  
for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  
the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  
be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this 
idea  earlier in the crisis.
 
SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy
At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The 
first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the 
governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is 
August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According 
to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has 
signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis 
and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates 
that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary 
bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  

The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond 
issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) 
stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, 
then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the 
state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and 
passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for 
bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and 
the DWR proportionately from rate payments."

899,allen-p,"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  
Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding 
the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business 
meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is 
even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try 
and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working 
and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet 
just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a 
round table discussion format.  

My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and 
jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time."

911,allen-p,"Tim,

Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our 
Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.

On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its 
forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been 
lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the 
second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The 
outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some 
additional insight?

Thank you,

912,allen-p,I would look at properties in San Antonio or Dallas.
913,allen-p,"Gary,

I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general 
contractor.  According to Johnnie, I would not be pay any less buying from 
the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within 
his region.  Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.  I believe 
he has sent you my plans.  They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.  

Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from 
the distributor?  If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you 
please email them to me as well?

Thank you for your time.  I am excited about potentially using your product.

Is there any detail on the gas cost proxy.  Which delivery points from which

on the language ""the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in 
California""?

Phillip"
915,allen-p,"Ned,

Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for 
this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current 
summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made 
to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal 
capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and 
withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 
existed at the time of this bid.

Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above 
assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.

I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email 
with comments.

Subject: Re: This morning's Commission meeting delayed  

Phil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed 
doors ""in smoke filled rooms"", if not directly between Commissioners then 
among FERC staffers.  Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that 
the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large 
part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which 
the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman 
began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or 
answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had 
some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:

Price caps are almost never the right answer
Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages
Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer
Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce 
demand, is not acceptable
Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would 
export California's problems to the West

This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty 
strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner 
out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and 
if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the 
agenda.  Hope this info helps.  Ray

Here is a photograph of a similar house.  The dimensions would be 56'Wide X 
41' Deep for the living area.  In addition there will be a 6' deep two story 
porch across the entire back and 30' across the front.  A modification to the 
front will be the addition of a gable across 25' on the left side.  The 
living area will be brought forward under this gable to be flush with the 
front porch.

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially 
set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever 
the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very 
short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not 
match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.

Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic

into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my 
budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing 
the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.  
However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.

I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this 
product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you 
that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously 
consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in 
cost over stick built.

Subject: CAISO demand reduction

Phillip et al.,

I have been digging into the answer to your question re: demand reduction in 
the West.  Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. 
March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand 
over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for 
temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates 
into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as 
compared with the previous year.

Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary 
reductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other 
forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making 
total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  
This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple 
more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% 
decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the 
retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it 
is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last 
year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in 
Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation 
are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of 
meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general 
economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least 
make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.

Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area 
only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC 
(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO 
portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in 
demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As 
you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum 
smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at 
least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its 
wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several 
mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are 
sharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly 
how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  
Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's 
economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of 
the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I 
think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already 
realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the 
non-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the 
WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around 
6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.

I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you 
with updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I 
hope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any 
questions or need any further information."

I sent you an email last week stating that I would be in San Marcos on 
Friday, April 13th.  However, my closing has been postponed.  As I mentioned 
I am going to have Cary Kipp draw the plans for the residence and I will get 
back in touch with you once he is finished.

Regarding the multifamily project, I am going to work with a project manager 
from San Antonio.  For my first development project, I feel more comfortable 
with their experience obtaining FHA financing.  We are working with Kipp 
Flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings.  Your bid 
for the construction is competive with other construction estimates.  I am 
still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local 
relationships.  I will get back in touch with you once we have made the final 
determination on unit mix and site plan.

Phillip Allen"
957,allen-p,"Jacques,

The amounts needed to fill in the blanks on Exhibit ""B"" are as follows:

Kipp Flores-Total Contract was $23,600 but $2,375 was paid and only $21,225 
is outstanding.

Kohutek- $2,150 

Cuatro- $37,800


George & Larry paid $3,500 for the appraisal and I agreed to reimburse this 
amount.

The total cash that Keith and I will pay the Sellers is $5,875 ($3,500 
appraisal and $2,375 engineering).    I couldn't find any reference to this 
cash consideration to be paid by the buyers.

Let me know if I need to do anything else before you can forward this to the  
sellers to be executed.

Phillip"
958,allen-p,"John,

Regarding the employment agreement, Mike declined without a counter.  Keith 
said he would sign for $75K cash/$250 equity.  I still believe Frank should 
receive the same signing incentives as Keith.  

Phillip"
959,allen-p,"Thanks for the response.  I think you are right that engaging an architect is 
the next logical step.  I had already contacted Cary Kipp and sent him the 
floor plan.
He got back to me yesterday with his first draft.  He took my plan and 
improved it.  I am going to officially engage Cary to draw the plans.  While 
he works on those I wanted to try and work out a detailed specification 
list.  Also, I would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and 
speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners.  I will be in San Marcos on Friday 
April 13th.  Are there any homes near completion that I could walk through 
that day?  Also can you provide some references?

Once I have the plans and specs, I will send them to you so you can adjust 
your bid.

Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)"
964,allen-p,"Lucy,

Here is a final 12/01 rentroll for you to save.  My only questions are:

1.  Neil Moreno in #21-he paid $120 on 11/24, but did not pay anything on 
12/01.  Even if he wants to swich to bi-weekly, he needs to pay at the 
beginning 
     of the two week period.  What is going on?

2.  Gilbert in #27-is he just late? 


Here is a file for 12/08."
965,allen-p,https://www4.rsweb.com/61045/
966,allen-p,"Jacques

I am out of the office for the rest of the week.  Have you ever seen anyone 
miss as much work as I have in the last 6 weeks?  I assure you this is 
unusual for me.
Hopefully we can sign some documents on Monday.  Call me on my cell phone if 
you need me.

Phillip"
967,allen-p,"Reagan,

I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts.

Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap?

What role would you play in obtaining financing?  Any experience with FHA 
221(d) loans?  

Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market 
quotes lower yet.  I have received estimates structured as follows:

  5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment
  2%- overhead
  4%- profit

I just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached an 
extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see even 
reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only 
generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about 
such a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down 
to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.  Any ideas?

I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you 
local connections.  I am not discounting those services.   I will be out of 
the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.

Phillip"
968,allen-p,"Cary,

Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple
farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.

A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:

There will be a double porch across the back just like the front
No dormers (Metal roof)
1/2 bath under stairs
Overall dimensions are 55 by 40


What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More
cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.
Reagan
suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want
to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about
bringing the left
side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.
That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front
porch would
be smaller.

I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead
and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a
builder.
I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned
my alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed
sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan
allowed.

Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence.  Below is a 
list of questions on the specs:

1.  Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine?  Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less 
and cost about the same?

2.  What type of floor joist would be used?  2x12 or some sort of factory 
joist?

3.  What type for roof framing?  On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?

4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  What 
type of insulation in floors and ceiling?  Batts or blown?  Fiberglass or 
Cellulose?

5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?

6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't know 
the difference between an apron and a stool.

7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent 
cracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?

8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partial 
one out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.

9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under 
the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.

10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermount 
stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.

11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.

12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?

13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?

14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Iron 
railings?

15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price except 
for change orders?

I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but 
this is a start.  I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.  I am going to 
call Cary Kipp to
see about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.

your group and let us know if you in fact use all these systems.  The West

Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and 
architect?  They have both sent me agreements.  The only payment
that George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect.  I have written 
personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the 
engineer.
I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the 
partnership.  

I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the 
partnership not with me.  Should I wait until the partnership has been 
conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership.

Let me know what you think.

Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates:

Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf 
(rentable)

What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent?

Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again?  You mentioned 2% 
overhead, 3 %  ???, and 5% profit.

Why is profit only 4%? 

Why are the architect fees up to $200K.  I thought they would be $80K.

What is the $617K of profit allowance?  Is that the developers profit to 
boost loan amount but not a real cost?

Total Closing and Application costs of 350K?  That seems very high?  Who 
receives the 2 points?  How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us?

Where is your 1%?  Are you receiving one of the points on the loan?

What is the status on the operating pro forma?  My back of the envelope puts 
NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40% 
expenses.  After debt service that would only leave $122K.  The coverage 
would only be 1.16.

Talk to you this afternoon.

 Wood stairs
 Two story porches on front and rear
 Granite counters in kitchens and baths
 Tile floors in upstairs baths
 Metal roof w/ gutters (No dormers)
 Cherry or Maple cabinets in kitchen & baths
 Solid wood interior doors
 Windows fully trimmed
 Crown molding in downstairs living areas
 2x6 wall on west side

 Undecided items include:

 Exterior stucco w/ stone apron and window trim  or rough white brick on 3-4 
sides
 
 
 I have faxed you the floor plans.  The dimensions may be to small to read.  
The overall dimensions are 55' X 40'.  For a total of 4400 sq ft under roof, 
but 
 only 3800 of livable space after you deduct the garage.  

 Are there any savings in the simplicity of the design?  It is basically a

Something that I forgot to ask you.  Do you know if Hugo is planning to 
replatt using an administrative process which I understand is quicker than 
the full replatting process of 3 weeks?

Also let me know about the parking.  The builder in San Marcos believed the 
plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code.  The townhomes 
across the street have a serious parking problem.  They probably planned for 
the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms.

The agreement looks fine.   My only comment is that George and Larry might 
object to the language that ""the bank that was requested to finance the 
construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs 
of the construction of the Project"".   Technically, that bank lowered the 
loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of 
equity that would be required. 

Did I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.

Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans, 
engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items are 
in a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speaking 
directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear on 
what is the best way to proceed with these consultants.  

The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do we 
need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and 
give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.

13:18 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Cal-ISO Pays $10M To Avoid Rolling Blackouts
Wed -Sources
(This article was originally published Wednesday)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Independent System Operator paid
about $10 million Wednesday for 1,000 megawatts of power from Powerex and
still faced a massive deficit that threatened electricity reliability in the
state, high-ranking market sources familiar with the ISO's operation told
Dow Jones Newswires.
But the ISO fell short of ordering rolling blackouts Wednesday for the third
consecutive day.
The ISO wouldn't comment on the transactions, saying it is sensitive market
information. But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia
Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest
region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid
about $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.
But that still wasn't enough juice.
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts
of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of
$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts
of power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the
$250/MWh price cap.
The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The
municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power
into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP
is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit
claims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville
Power Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the
market at prices 10 times higher.
Powerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying all
transactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000
megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts
- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.
The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state
no matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,
which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having
to compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing
to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.
The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during
a conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency
Wednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared
when the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is
interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.
But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as
a means of attracting additional electricity resources.
""In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,""
Dorinson said.
Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy
unit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &
Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of
the high-priced power.
SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high
wholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by
nearly $1 billion, analysts said. It's still unclear whether retail
customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity
rates or if companies will absorb the costs.

13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South Bay
Pwr Plant
(This article was originally published Wednesday)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California Independent
System Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke Energy
Corp.'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,
Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.
The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state
since Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the
reasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.
About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday,
7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the
ISO.
The ISO manages grid reliability.
As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert
at 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would
dip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid
collapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rolling
blackouts.
The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),
Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE).
Duke's 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representatives
in June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said.

Power Plants
(This article was originally published Wednesday)

   By Jessica Berthold
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--AES Corp. (AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said
Wednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by
some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate
reasons.
The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power
grid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public
Utilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power
plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns,
ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.
The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for
unplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency
for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and
customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be
called on to do so.
As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)
said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday
evening.
Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES
and Dynegy Tuesday evening.
AES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspection
of the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday
morning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron
Thomas said.
Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representatives
returned Wednesday for a full inspection.

   AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits

The Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have
used up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken down
two weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality
Management District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,
Thomas said.
AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire
Huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos
and Redondo Beach plants.
The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES
has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the
company $20 million for polluting.
""We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it,""
Thomas said. ""It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality
district's"" authority.
As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES
could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off
line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.

   Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC

Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday
evening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line
Wednesday.
""I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if you
need to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'"" said Dynegy
spokesman Lynn Lednicky.
Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and
the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could
pose a safety hazard if not repaired.
""We've been doing all we can to get back in service,"" Lednicky said. ""We
even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.""
Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation of
why its units were off line.

it is worked out today or tomorrow, I would like to get whatever documents 
need to be
completed to convey the partnership done.  I need to work with the engineer 
and architect to get things moving.  I am planning on  writing a personal 
check to the engineer while I am setting up new accounts.  Let me know if 
there is a reason I should not do this.

Thanks for all your help so far.  Between your connections and expertise in 
structuring the loan, you saved us from getting into a bad deal.

Phillip"
996,allen-p,"Larrry,

I realize you are disappointed about the project.  It is not my desire for 
you to be left with out of pocket expenses.  The only item from your list 
that I need further 
clarification is the $15,000 worth of extensions.  You mentioned that this 
was applied to the cost of the land and it actually represents your cash 
investment in the land.  I agree that you should be refunded any cash 
investment.  My only request is that you help me locate this amount on the 
closing statement or on some other document.

I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of 
value and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able to 
use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, 
appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in 
extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like 
earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I 
didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear 
this up.

Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.  
Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and 
the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand, 
conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was 
clean.  What is your inclination?

Call as soon as you have a chance to review.

Subject: Behind the Stage Two


FYI Western Price Survey Contacts

Cal-ISO's declaration of Stage Two alert this morning was triggered
in part by decision of Bonneville Power Administration to cease
hour-to-hour sales into California of between 600 MW and 1,000
MW that it had been making for the past week. According to BPA,
it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet
biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in
order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had
been telling California's Department of Water Resources that the
sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.

Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than
yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back.
Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because
of concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sending
exchange energy into California, however.

More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of the
Western Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter."
1003,allen-p,"Thanks for the information.  It would be helpful if you would send the 
detailed worksheet that you mentioned.

I am surprised to hear that the only restricted shares left are the ones 
granted this January.  I have always elected to defer any distributions of 
restricted stock.  I believe I selected the minimum amount required to be 
kept in enron stock (50%).   Are you saying that all the previous grants have 
fully vested and been distributed to my deferral account?

Thank you for looking into this issue.

Subject: Bishops Corner, Ltd. -- Restructure or Buyout

Dear Phillip and Keith: 

We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash 
expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of 
all note obligations and design contracts.? 

As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and 
existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, 
and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which 
current unpaid invoices due total $37,325.

Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this 
project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design 
and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of 
our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or 
rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? 

Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a 
percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on 
your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, 
or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the 
second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per 
year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these 
valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the 
forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in 
the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future 
projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per 
month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the 
attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings 
the total net buyout to $78,946.? 

We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we 
offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout 
offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are 
prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? 
If this is your 



choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, 
Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then 
draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the 
Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout 
amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts.

Thank you.

Here is the buyout spreadsheet again with a slight tweak in the format.  The 
summary  presents the numbers as only $1400 in concessions."
1010,allen-p,"Gentlemen,

Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to 
date.  I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property is 
still in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot 
and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a 
topographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to 
coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the 
smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going 
to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to 
complete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which 
$14,000 are due now for work completed.  

We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by 
the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can 
continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's 
number is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and 
ask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call 
and he was fine with that.  

Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp 
Flores can be used.

Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left very 
optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.

Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about 
moving this project forward.

George finally sent me some information.  Please look over his email.  He 
wants us to buy him out.  Keith and I think this is a joke.  

We still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to 
determine if it has any value going forward.  I don't believe the architect 
work will be of any use to us.  I don't think they deserve any compensation 
for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were 
proposing was unsupportable by the market.  

My version of a buyout is attached.

I need your expert advise.  I am ready to offer my version or threaten to 
foreclose.  Do they have a case that they are due money for their time?  
Since their cost
and fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I 
wouldn't think they would stand a chance.  There isn't any time to waste so I 
want to respond to their offer asap.

Call me with your thoughts.

Subject:  Sagewood Phase II


George,

Thank you for the opportunity to review your financing request for the 
Sagewood
Phase II project.  Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the
project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are a
number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward
on the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a
Bedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjusted
pro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are
acheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about 
500+
units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, 
this,
we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious
effect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requested
loan amount to $8,868,000.

I have summarized our issues as follows:

1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:

     Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment
     Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR
     2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475
     3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417

2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit
turn over.

3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).

4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support
debt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x 
debt
coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.

5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.

6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide
equity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:

     Land -                   $1,121,670
     Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000
     Cash Equity              $1,419,268
     Total                    $2,955,938

7. Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage 
of
actual hard construction costs.

Phillip Allen"
1020,allen-p,"Darrell,

Today I let the builder/developer know that I would not proceed with his 
excessively high cost estimates.  As he did not have the funds to take on the 
land himself, he was agreeable to turning over the land to me.  I would like 
to proceed and develop the property. 

 My thought is to compare the financing between Bank One and FHA.  I would 
also like to compare construction and development services between what you 
can do and a local builder in San Marcos that I have been speaking with.  
Making a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems to 
be in order.  I am trying to get the status of engineering and architectural 
work to date.  Once again the architect is Kipp Florres and the engineer is 
Quattro Consultants out of Buda.  Let me know if you have an opinion about 
either.

I look forward to working with you.  Talk to you tomorrow.

I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still have
the concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our
project are too high.  I have gathered more information that support my
concerns.  Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around
$10.5 million.  The components are as follows:

     Unit Cost, Site work, &
     builders profit($52/sf)             $7.6 million

     Land                      1.15

     Interim Financing               .85

     Common Areas                     .80

     Total                         $10.4

Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable
to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.

Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A
properties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can
produce the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for
location and the seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize
that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates
that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not
believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.
Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.

After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost
estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  He
feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8
million.  We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.

Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that
we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5
million.   We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon to 
discuss
alternatives.

Thanks again."

Here are few questions regarding the 2/16 rentroll:

#2  Has she actually paid the $150 deposit.  Her move in date was 2/6.  It is 
not on any rentroll that I can see.

#9  Explain again what deposit and rent is transferring from #41 and when she 
will start paying on #9

#15  Since he has been such a good tenant for so long.  Stop trying to 
collect the $95 in question.

#33  Missed rent.  Are they still there?

#26  I see that she paid a deposit.  But the file says she moved in on 1/30.  
Has she ever paid rent?  I can't find any on the last three deposits.

#44  Have the paid for February?  There is no payment since the beginning of 
the year.

#33  You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't 
see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit?

The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent.  I need you to 
figure these out immediately.

I emailed you a new file for 2/23 and have attached the last three rentroll 
in case you need to research these questions.

I will not be in the office next week.  If I can get connected you might be 
able to email me at pallen70@hotmail.com.  Otherwise try and work with Gary 
on pressing issues.  If there is an emergency you can call me at 713-410-4679.

1037,allen-p,"George,

I can take a day off the week I get back from vacation.  Any day between 
March 5th-9th would work but Friday or Thursday would be my preference.

Regarding the differences in the two estimates, I don't want to waste your 
time explaining the differences if the 1st forecast was very rough.  The 
items I listed moved dramatically.  Also, some of the questions were just 
clarification of what was in a number.  

Let's try and reach an agreement on the construction manager issue tomorrow 
morning.

Phillip -

George Richards asked that I drop you a line this morning to go over some
details on the San Marcos project.

1.  First, do you know if I am to receive a personal financial statement from
Keith?  I want to make sure my credit write-up includes all the principals in
the transaction.

2.  Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC) 
will
be in the range of 75% - 80%.  The proposed Loan to Value of 75% is within the
acceptable range for a typical Multi-Family deal.  Given the above pro-forma
performance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my credit
officer as an 80% LTC.  This, of course, is subject to the credit officer
signing off on the deal.

3.  The Bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the Developers
deferred profit.  Typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget as
deferred profit has been acceptable.

Thanks,

There have been some updates to the cost.  The principal change is in the

have been increased.  I still believe that the total cost is more than

The manager's unit is columns J-L, but the total is not included in the B&N

Phillip,

I spoke with AMF's broker today, and they will be satisfied with the deal if
we can get the school to agree to limit the current land use restrictions to
the terms that are in the existing agreement.  They do not want the school
to come back at a later date for something different.  Doug Bell will meet
with a school official on Monday to see what their thoughts are about the
subject.  It would be hard for them to change the current agreement, but AMF
wants something in writing to that effect.  I spoke to AMF's attorney today,
and explained the situation.  They are OK with deal if AMF is satisfied.

AMF's broker said that they will be ready to submit their site plan after
the March 29 hearing.  We may close this deal in April.

The Stage is still on go.  An assumption package has been sent to the buyer,
and I have overnighted a copy of the contract and a description of the
details to Wayne McCoy.

I will be gone Thurs. and Fri. of this week.  I will be checking my

Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies 
forecasts?  I will set up a room with Kim.

Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen:

1.  Review and document systems and processes  -   The handoffs from ERMS, 
TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the 
       parties trying to make improvements.  I think I understand ERMS and 
TAGG but the issues facing 
       scheduling in Unify are grey.

2.  Review and audit complex deals- Under the ""assume it is messed up"" 
policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need 
further      scrutiny.

3.  Review risk books-  Is Enron accurately accounting for physical 
imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?

4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design training 
courses, review progress and make cuts.

5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.  Are we looking at 
everything we should?  Putting a person with a trading mentality should add 
   some value and direction to the group.


In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD 
to work part time to get it done.

1052,allen-p,"The spinning bikes are so much better than the life cycles.  Would you 
consider placing several spinning bikes out with the other exercise equipment 
and running a spinning video on the TV's.  I think the equipment would be 
used much more.  Members could just jump on a bike and follow the video any 
time of day.

Let me know if this is possible.

After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different 
definitions of cost and profit.  Their version includes the salary of a 
superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third 
party subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of ""construction management"" 
fees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be 
paid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finally 
the builders profit of 1.4 million.

Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out 
of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, if 
they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?  
We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition 
to the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have been 
in the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates and 
the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management 
fee is included.

George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  I will 
review and let you know what I think.

The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention.  They are agreeable to 
the 3 out 4 approval process.

Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  only 
true costs + 1.4 million.

Phillip these are the volumes that AEC is considering selling at Opal over 
the next five years.  The structure they are looking for is a firm physical 
sale at a NYMEX related price.  There is a very good chance that they will do 
this all with one party.  We are definitely being considered as that party.  
Given what we have seen in the marketplace they may be one of the few 
producers willing to sell long dated physical gas for size into Kern River.

What would be your bid for this gas?

This should probably be researched further.  If they can really build this 
many plants it could have a huge impact on the Cal border basis.  Obviously 
it is dependent on what capacity is added on Kern, PGT and TW but it is hard 
to envision enough subscriptions to meet this demand.  Even if it is 
subscribed it will take 18 months to 2 years to build new pipe therefore the 
El Paso 1.2 Bcf/d could be even more valuable.

Here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject 
to caps.  I wrote it as if it were from you.  It should come from the manager.

It is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there 
unit is when they move in.  This needs to be written in on their lease.

When you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize 
that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up.  

Have my Dad read the memo before you put it out.   You guys can make changes 
if you need to.

Here is the rentroll for this Friday.  Sorry it is so late.



There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2.

1.  I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank 
is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865.   The missing money on the 
spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.

2.  #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?

3.  #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?

4.  #11 Missed on 2/2?

5.  #13 Missed on 1/26?

6.  #14  missed on 2/2?

7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?

8.  #20a missed on 2/2?

9.  #35 missed on 2/2?

My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.  
You may have sent me a message over the ""chat"" line that I don't remember on 
some of these.  I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the 
bank deposit.

Will have some time today to work on a utility letter.  Tried to call Wade 
last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him.  Will try again today.

I believe that a doctor from Seguin is going to make an offer.  Did you meet

3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.

4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?

5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.

With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a 
solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes 
costs.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and I 
would like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to fax 
all invoices within 48 hours.  We also would want online access to the 
checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing 
but invoices were not being submitted.

Let me know if you can draft these agreements.  The GP issue may need some 
tweaking.

My target is to get $225 back out of the stage.  Therefore, I could take a 
sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K.  This would still only 
require $75K cash from the buyer.  After broker fees and a title policy, I 
would net around $20K cash.  

You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or 
higher with the terms described in the 1st email.  Do you want to give the 
New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal.


Phillip"
1091,allen-p,"Jeff,

I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 
years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%.  There are several 
reasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, the 
large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer 
are the three biggest concerns.  

What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the 
buyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come due 
until September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold the 
property.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to make 
the deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinance 
is pushing too far.

Can you clarify the dates in the contract.  Is the effective date the day the 
earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?

Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.  I got your fax from the New 
Braunfels buyer.  If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get 
started on the list.

Subject: re: book admin for Pipe/Gas daily option book  

When we meet,  I would like to address the following issues:

1.)  I had at least 5 people here past midnight on both nights and I have 
several people who have not left before 10:30 this week. 
2.)  It is my understanding that Susan was still booking new day deals on 
Thursday night at 8:30 b/c she did not get deal tickets from the trading 
floor until after 5:00 p.m.
3.)  It is also my understanding that Susan is done with the p&l and 
benchmark part of her book often times by 6:00,  but that what keeps her here 
late is usually running numerous extra models and spreadsheets.  (One 
suggestion might be a permanent IT person on this book.)  (This was also my 
understanding from Kyle Etter,  who has left the company.)

I would like to get this resolved as soon as possible so that Larry can get 
the information that he needs to be effective and so that we can run books 
like this and not lose good people.

Thanks

Lucy,

Please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the ""Rent Due"" column.  The 
other questions I had about last week's rent are:

#15  Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26.  What is 
going on?

#25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit

#27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.  Why?

I spoke to Jeff Smith.  I think he was surprised that we were set up with 
email and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff know 
that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the 
property.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show 
them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.  

Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right 
now.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet 
but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wade 
continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the 
property's tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better and 
better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.  

Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  It 
is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move 
in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  I 
realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and 
your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be 
working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running 
an errand for the property.

I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this 
time.  We can look at again later in the year.

I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.

The probability of building a house this year is increasing.  I have shifted 
to a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I could 
not work out in the plan we discussed previously.  Now, I am leaning more 
towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  One 
wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 
kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage + 
guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  This 
plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the 
courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor 
living.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. 
 The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass 
skylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to have 
single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.  

I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.  I would 
like to come and visit you again this month.  If it would work for you, I 
would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.  I 
would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we 
didn't have time for.  I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan.

1105,allen-p,"Jeff,

Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about.

1.  Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and 
repairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor 
cost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on 
repairs.

2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite 
manager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has 
interest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager 
that could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to a 
management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager 
onsite.

3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If you 
want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.

4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structure 
this deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.

My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.  This property 
definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.


Sales Price  705,000

1st Lien   473,500

2nd Lien  225,000

Transfer fee    7,500

Cash required   14,500


NOI   100,000

1st Lien    47,292

2nd Lien   23,694

Cash flow  29,014

Cash on cash  200%


These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then 
cash on cash return would be more like 300%.   This doesn't reflect the 
additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years 
for a higher price.

Do you want to reconsider?  Let me know.

=09=09 Subject: CPUC Audit Report on Edison

The following are the highlights from the Executive Summary of the KPMG aud=
it=20
report on Southern California Edison:
=20
I. Cash Needs
Highlights:
SCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=
plete=20
cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20
program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=
s=20
and other measures.=20
Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20
available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=
.8=20
million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20
conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.
II. Credit Relationships
Highlights:
SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20
extend or renew credit as it has become due.
At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.
SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=
lt.=20
Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=
nd=20
payable.
SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond=
=20
indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20
indebtedness if it were feasible to do so.
Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =
its=20
rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade=
=20
issues within the last three weeks.
III. Energy Cost Scenarios
Highlights
This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20
various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=
 such=20
scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.
IV. Cost Containment Initiatives
Highlights
SCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.
The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital=
=20
improvement component as follows (in millions):
Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77
Capital Improvement Costs                383
Total                                             $ 460
The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to=
=20
be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=
om=20
contract employees.
Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the=
=20
most part being deferred to a future date.
SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20
executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20
savings of approximately $92 million.
V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20
Activity)
Highlights:
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20
Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20
includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20
million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s=
=20
Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.
Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=
e=20
end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit=
=20
balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20
D.01-01-018.
Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20
generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20
tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20
expressed in the TRA, are overstated.
TURN Proposal
As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=
RN=20
to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=
s.=20
Our comments are summarized as follows:
The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=
t=20
would not directly generate nor use cash.
The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=
ift=20
costs between two regulatory assets.
TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=
 the=20
revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =
in=20
the TRA is overstated.
VI. Flow of Funds Analysis
Highlights:
In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a=
=20
positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.
During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to=
=20
its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.
Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its=
=20
shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=
on=20
stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=
ve=20
and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.
[there is no Section VII]
=20
VIII. Earnings of California Affiliates
SCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500=
=20
million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20
In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.=
=20
This increase correlates to the increase in market prices
for natural gas for the same period.

That is good news about Leander.  

Now for the stage.  I would like to get it sold by the end of March.   I have 
about $225K invested in the stagecoach, 
 it looks like I need to get around $745K to breakeven.  

I don't need the cash out right now so if I could get a personal guarantee 
and Jaques Craig can 
work out the partnership transfer, I would definitely be willing to carry a 
second lien.  I understand second liens are going for 10%-12%.
Checkout this spreadsheet.





These numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes.   
However,  I am very concerned about the way it is being shown.  Having Lucy 
show it is not a good idea.  I need you to meet the buyers and take some 
trips over to get more familar with the property.  My dad doesn't have the 
time and I don't trust 
Lucy or Wade to show it correctly.  I would prefer for you to show it from 
now on.  

I will have the operating statements complete through December by this 
Friday.

Subject: Re: SM134  

George,

Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders 
profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be 
recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would 
be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.



Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the 
investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned 
earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as 
part of the construction contract.  

Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look 
like here are a few ideas:

 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from 
higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.

 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 
1 complete in November)
      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule
      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule

This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but 
could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule 
must be discussed and agreed upon.

Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626

Phillip:

It looks like a deal with the non gas fired QFs is iminent.  One for the gas 
generators is still quite a ways off.  

The non gas fired QFs will be getting a fixed price for 5 years and reverting 
back to their contracts thereafter.  They also will give back 

I would expect that the gas deal using an implied gas price times a heat rate 
would be very very difficult to close.  Don't expect hedgers to come any time 
soon.

I will keep you abreast of developments.

Subject: Status of QF negotiations on QFs & Legislative Update

This from a conference call with IEP tonight at 5 pm:

RE;  Non-Gas-fired QFs -- The last e-mail I sent includes the latest version 
of the IEP proposal.  Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially 
complete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed with 
the IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would ""retain"" $106 million (of 
what, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who 
switched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the 
QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December 
(and maybe earlier).

PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the 
Force Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get 
some assurances of payment. 

SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due 
on 2/2/01.

For gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E's 
purchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements 
(Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be 
resolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.  No discussions on this 
occurred today.

Status of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will 
happen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.  
Plan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg's new bill .  Hydro as security is 
dead. Republicans were very much opposed to it."
1119,allen-p,"George,

 I received the drawings.  They look good at first glance.  I will look at 
them in depth this weekend.  The proforma was in the winmail.dat format which 
I cannot open.  Please resend in excel or a pdf format.  If you will send it

Subject: Analyst Interviews Needed - 2/15/01


	

All,

The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that 
need to be addressed immediately.  While we anticipate many new Analysts 
joining Enron this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it 
necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting 
event.  We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting 
approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed.  I am asking that you forward 
this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above).  We will conduct 
first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the 
afternoon.  We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning 
(9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session.  Please submit your 
response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date.  In 
addition, we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking 
one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer.   Thanks in 
advance for your cooperation.

  


Thank you,
Jana"
1121,allen-p,"Nick,

There is a specific program that we are using to recruit, train, and mentor 
new traders on the gas and power desks.    The trading track program is being 
coordinated by Ted Bland.  I have forwarded him your resume.  Give him a call 
and he will fill you in on the details of the program.

#32 and #29 are fine.  

#28 paid weekly on 1/5.  Then he switched to biweekly.  He should have paid 
260 on 1/12.  Two weeks rent in advance.  Instead he paid 260 on 1/19.  He 
either needs to get back on schedule or let him know he is paying in the 
middle of his two weeks.  He is only paid one week in advance.  This is not a

Date: 01/20/01 22:15

As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile 
Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas 
storage number. 

The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the 
forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a 
supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. 

""Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,"" said William Burson, 
a trader. ""It makes the market for natural gas."" 

But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas 
Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the 
storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the 
numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than 
reality. 

""It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what 
we are reporting,"" McGill said. 

As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- 
and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing 
fingers at Wall Street. 

Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently 
stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for 
the rise in gas prices. 

""It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,"" Adik 
told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. 

In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric 
utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. 

Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame 
for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their 
customers and constituents from such price spikes. 

Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take 
precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price 
insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas 
prices before they soared. 

""We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said Paul 
Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. 

But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. 

""There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to 
change,"" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security 
Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. 


Hot topic 

Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In 
many circles, little else is discussed. 

The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is 
facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the 
previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as 
well. 

The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of 
his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial 
pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. 

""It's the talk of the town here,"" he said. 

A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per 
thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile 
to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by 
customers. 

But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand 
cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage 
for winter. 

There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, 
prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information 
Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating 
bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. 

But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, 
including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas 
markets. 

""It's all about the weather,"" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. 

Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York 
traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile 
commodity in the world. 


Setting the price 

In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of 
gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading 
contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had 
widespread influence over gas prices. 

The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon 
as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale 
prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from 
utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what 
they pay for the gas they expect to use. 

There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention 
of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge 
of natural gas. 

But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to 
know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all 
futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to 
their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money 
in a short time. 

As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less 
than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. 
Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's 
weekly storage numbers. 

Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to 
need in the winter. 

Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than 
average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in 
hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. 

Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be 
sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the 
concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. 

Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage 
numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the 
association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. 

But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice 
president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had 
continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. 

""I was getting worried,"" he said. 

Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. 
Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices 
dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. 


Just passing through 

Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but 
pass their fuel costs on to customers. 

Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas 
charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas 
Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. 

Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last 
month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could 
be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve 
energy. 

Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to 
save an average customer about $25 this winter. 

Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an 
extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not 
guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. 

Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left 
customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether 
they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel 
costs. 

On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public 
Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to 
perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. 

""Consumers are taking all the risk,"" Micheel said. ""It's time to consider 
some changes.""

Subject: California Action Update 1-14-00

Enron has agreed that the key issue is to focus on solving the S-T buying 
needs.  Attached is a spreadsheet that outlines the $ magnitude of the next 
few months.

TALKING POINTS:

Lot's of questions about DWR becoming the  vehicle for S-T buying and there 
is a significant legal risk for it becoming the vehicle.  WE DO NEED 
SOMETHING TO BRIDGE BEFORE WE PUT IN L-T CONTRACTS.
Huge and growing shortfall ($3.2B through March 31, 2001) 
The SOONER YOU CAN PUT IN L-T CONTRACTS STOP THE BLEEDING.
Bankruptcy takes all authority out of the Legislature's hands.

ACTION ITEMS:

1. Energy Sales Participation Agreement During Bankruptcy

Michael Tribolet will be contacting John Klauberg to discuss how to organize 
a Participation Agreement to sell to UDCs in Bankruptcy while securing Super 
Priority.

2. Legislative Language for CDWR (?) Buying Short-Term

Sandi McCubbin / Jeff Dasovich will lead team to offer new language to meet 
S-T requirements of UDCs.  Key is to talk with State of California Treasurer 
to see if the $ can be found or provided to private firms.  ($3.5B by end of 
April).  Pat Boylston will develop ""public benefit"" language for options 
working with Mike Day.  He can be reached at 503-294-9116 or 
pgboylston@stoel.com.

3. Get Team to Sacramento

Get with Hertzberg to discuss the options (Bev Hansen).  Explain the 
magnitude of the problem.  Get Mike Day to help draft language.  

4. See if UDCs have any Thoughts

Steve Kean will communicate with UDCs to see if they have any solutions or 
thougths.  Probably of limited value.

5. Update List

Any new information on this should be communicated to the following people as 
soon as possible.  These people should update their respective business units.

Enclosed is the cost breakdown for the appraiser.  Note that the
construction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our
standard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio
of 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.

Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs
are high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have
actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf
without overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.

It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairly
sure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.

I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are
$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3
bedroom.  Additional revenues could be generated by building detached
garages, which would rent for $50-75 per month.

1146,allen-p,"George,

Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders 
profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be 
recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would 
be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.



Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the 
investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned 
earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as 
part of the construction contract.  

Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look 
like here are a few ideas:

 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from 
higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.

 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 
1 complete in November)
      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule
      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule

This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but 
could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule 
must be discussed and agreed upon.

Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626

1147,allen-p,"Lucy,

Here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages.  There 
are alot of overages.  It will probably get worse this month because of all 
the cold weather.

You need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap.  
This needs to be handwritten on all new leases.

I am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet.  We 
also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need 
to conserve energy if they don't want to exceed their cap.  I will write 
something today.

collecting.

 Utility overages for #26 and #44?  Where did you get these amounts?  For 
what periods?

 
What is going on with #42.   Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!!  
That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money 
and time remodeling.  I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first 
asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like 
leaky pipes.  If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the 
apartment and charge them for the labor.  Then we will perform monthly 
inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property.  This tenant has 
been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off.

I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so 
I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank.  Is this 
right?  Has the deposit been made yet?


 A rentroll for Jan 5th will follow shortly.

Subject: Meeting with Governor Davis, need for additional comments/suggestions

We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA.  In attendance were Ken Lay, 
the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. 
spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his 
ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next 
week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.  
Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on 
my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff 
Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our 
proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation 
based on the governor's comments:

Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that 
we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing 
communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to 
go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what 
the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more 
work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He 
talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail 
level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the 
benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he 
would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power 
(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented 
solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix 
the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.
Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also 
included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed 
interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a 
goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities 
to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate 
analysts and other ""nonadvocates"" to develop solutions to a number of issues 
including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  
He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas 
purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding 
some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.
His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously 
under serious consideration and some of which were mere ""brainstorming"".  
Some of these ideas would require legislative action.
State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a ""couple"" of 
generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that 
they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This 
was a frequently recurring theme.
Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus 
basis to consumers.
Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in 
California.
State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more 
widely deploy distributed generation.
Expand in-state gas production.
Take state lands gas royalties in kind.
negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for 
addtional gas supplies.
Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant 
maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at 
any one time.
Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.
Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear 
more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be 
able to help out here).
Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made 
some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy 
some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation 
thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control 
approach with generators.
Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.
To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's 
thoughts and get them to Kari)
He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- 
not just the 5 one year strips.
He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.
He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the 
deal.
He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the 
forward contracting issues.
Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today."

1160,allen-p,"Gentlemen,

 I continue to speak to an attorney for help with the investment structure 
and a mortgage broker for help with the financing.  Regarding the financing, 
I am working with Jim Murnan at Pinnacle Mortgage here in Houston.  I have 
sent him some information on the project, but he needs financial information 
on you.  Can you please send it to him.  His contact information is:  phone 
(713)781-5810, fax (713)781-6614, and email jim123@pdq.net.

 I know Larry has been working with a bank and they need my information.  I 
hope to pull that together this afternoon.

 I took the liberty of calling Thomas Reames from the Frog Pond document.  He 
was positive about his experience overall.  He did not seem pleased with the 
bookkeeping or information flow to the investor.  I think we should discuss 
these procedures in advance.

 Let's continue to speak or email frequently as new developments occur.

Phillip"
1161,allen-p,"Jim,

 I would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project I 
described to you last week.  The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in 
San Marcos.  There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a 
couple of other investors involved.  As I mentioned last week, I would like 
to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not 
require the investors to personally guarantee.  If there is a creative way to 
structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.  One idea that has 
been mentioned is to obtain a ""forward commitment"" in order to reduce the 
equity required.  I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this 
nature are normally financed.  Specifically, the transition from interim to 
permanent financing.  I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be 
important to banks. 

 I am faxing you a project summary.  And I will have the builder/developer 
email or fax his financial statement to you.

 Let me know what else you need.  The land is scheduled to close mid January.


Phillip Allen"
1162,allen-p,"Jeff,

Everything should be done for closing on the Leander deal on the 29th.  I 
have fed ex'd the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out 
tomorrow.    When will more money be required?  Escrow for roads?  Utility 
connections?  Other rezoning costs?  

What about property taxes?  The burnet land lost its ag exemption while I 
owned it.  Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this 
property?  Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes 
once the property is rezoned?  Do we need to find a farmer and give him 
grazing rights?

What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and 
annexing?  I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and 
American Multifamily walking on this deal.  So I just want to make sure we 
are pushing the process as fast as we can.

you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.









As far as recommendations, here is a short list:

 1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales 
above monthly index without enough consideration of future 
      replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be 
injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.
                    This creates a shortage in later months.

 2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet 
demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.  
                      Specific questions should include:  

  1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order 
to fill storage?

  2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too 
much gas from Socal's system.  
       I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their 
own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than 
their injection capablity, but injected far less.

 3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short 
term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major 
                    LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating 
rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market 
and the 
     consumer has benefitted.  


Call me if you need any more input.

 I want to get the lease data and tenant data updated.  
  
  The critical information is  1.  Move in or lease start date
      2.  Lease expiration date
      3.  Rent
      4.  Deposit 
  
  If you have the info you can
  fill in these items  1.  Number of occupants
      2.  Workplace
      

  All the new leases should be the long form.



 The apartments that have new tenants since these columns have been updated 
back in October are  #3,5,9,11,12,17,21,22,23,25,28,33,38.
  

 I really need to get this by tomorrow.  Please use the rentroll_1215 file to 
input the correct information on all these tenants.  And email it to me 
tomorrow.  You should have all this information on their leases and 
applications.

Here is a new file for 12/15.




For the rentroll for 12/08 here are my questions:

 #23 & #24 did not pay.  Just late or moving?

 #25 & #33 Both paid 130 on 12/01 and $0 on 12/08.  What is the deal?

 #11  Looks like she is caught up.  When is she due again?

As I told Mike, we will file this out-of-time tomorrow as a supplement to our

The back office is having a hard time dealing with the $11 million dollars

from the Office of the Chairman.    Is your understanding that the West desk 
will receive origination each month based on the schedule below.

 
 The Office of the Chairman agrees to grant origination to the Denver desk as 
follows:

October 2000  $1,395,000
November 2000 $1,350,000
December 2000 $1,395,000
January 2001  $   669,600
February 2001  $   604,800
March 2001  $   669,600
April 2001  $   648,000
May 2001  $   669,600
June 2001  $   648,000
July 2001  $   669,600
August 2001  $   669,600
September 2001 $   648,000
October 2001  $   669,600
November 2001 $   648,000
December 2001 $   669,600

This schedule represents a demand charge payable to NBP Energy Pipelines by 
the Denver desk.  The demand charge is $.18/MMBtu on 250,000 MMBtu/Day 
(Oct-00 thru Dec-00) and 120,000 MMBtu/Day (Jan-01 thru Dec-01).  The ENA 
Office of the Chairman has agreed to reimburse the west desk for this expense.

We linked the file you sent us to telerate and we replace >40000 equals $250 
to a 41.67 heat rate.  We applied forward gas prices to historical loads.  I 
guess this gives us a picture of a low load year and a normal load year.  
Prices seem low.  Looks like November NP15 is trading above the cap based on 
Nov 99 loads and current gas prices.  What about a forecast for this November 
loads.

 The San Marcos project is sounding very attractive.  I have one other 
investor in addition to Keith that has interest.  Some additional background 
information on Larry and yourself would be helpful.

 Background Questions:
 
 Please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in 
Creekside.

 Please list projects completed during the last 5 years.  Include the project 
description, investors, business entity, 

 Please provide the names and numbers of prior investors.

 Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on 
recent projects.


 With regard to the proposed investment structure, I would suggest a couple 
of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between Creekside and the 
investors. 


 Preferable Investment Structure:

 Developers guarantee note, not investors.

 Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing.

 Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns.

         Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should 
tackle these issues now.  These questions are not intended to be offensive in 
any way.  It is my desire to build a successful project with Creekside that 
leads to future opportunities.  I  am happy to provide you with any 
information that you need to evaluate myself or Keith as a business partner.

Sincerely,

Phillip Allen"

 Patti Sullivan held together the scheduling group for two months while Randy 
Gay was on a personal leave.  She displayed a tremendous amount of commitment 
to the west desk during that time.  She frequently came to work before 4 AM 
to prepare operations reports.  Patti worked 7 days a week during this time.  
If long hours were not enough, there was a pipeline explosion during this 
time which put extra volatility into the market and extra pressure on Patti.  
She didn't crack and provided much needed info during this time.

 Patti is performing the duties of a manager but being paid as a sr. 
specialist.  Based on her heroic efforts, she deserves a PBR.  Let me know 
what is an acceptable cash amount.

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

George Richards

 Regarding Patti Sullivan's contributions to the west desk this year, her 
efforts deserve recognition and a PBR award.  Patti stepped up to fill the 
gap left by Randy Gay's personal leave.  Patti held together the scheduling 
group for about 2 month's by working 7days a week during this time.  Patti 
was always the first one in the office during this time.  Frequently, she 
would be at work before 4 AM to prepare the daily operation package.  All the 
traders came to depend on the information Patti provided.   This information 
has been extremely critical this year due to the pipeline explosion and size 
of the west desk positions.

SE:NT)(TSE:NT.) today reported results for the third quarter and first nine=
 months of 2001 prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accountin=
g principles.   Revenues from continuing operations were US$3.69 billion fo=
r the third quarter of 2001 compared to US$6.73 billion in the same period =
in 2000. Pro forma net loss from continuing operations(a) for the third qua=
rter of 2001, excluding incremental provisions and other charges, was US$85=
4 million or US$0.27 per common share. Including the incremental provisions=
 and other charges, pro forma net loss from continuing operations(a) for th=
e third quarter of 2001 was US$2.18 billion, or US$0.68 per common share, c=
ompared to pro forma net earnings of US$597 million, or US$0.19 per common =
share on a diluted basis, for the same period in 2000.   In the quarter, in=
cremental charges included in the pro forma net loss from continuing operat=
ions(a) were comprised of: US$750 million (pre-tax) for excess and obsolete=
 inventory, primarily related to Optical Inter-City; US$767 million (pre-ta=
x) for increased provisions related to trade receivables and customer finan=
cing; and US$380 million (pre-tax) primarily related to charges associated =
with certain third party investments. The Company also recorded: a US$801 m=
illion (pre-tax) charge for restructuring associated with the completion of=
 the workforce reductions and facilities closures announced in June 2001; a=
nd a US$223 million (pre-tax) charge primarily related to the approximately=
 50 percent reduction in manufacturing capacity of its Photonics Components=
 business.   Including Acquisition Related Costs(a), stock option compensat=
ion from acquisitions and divestitures, and one-time gains and charges, Nor=
tel Networks recorded a net loss from continuing operations in the third qu=
arter of 2001 of US$3.47 billion or US$1.08 per common share.   ""Revenues f=
or the quarter reflected the challenges presented as the telecom industry a=
djusted to new levels of spending,"" said John Roth, president and chief exe=
cutive officer Nortel Networks. ""Our bottom line results reflected the impa=
ct of actions we have taken to adjust to the new business levels. During th=
e third quarter of 2001, Nortel Networks continued to aggressively implemen=
t its work plan to reduce its cost structure and streamline operations. The=
 Company is in the final stages of implementing a cost structure to drive b=
reak even at a quarterly revenue level well below US$4 billion. The structu=
re is expected to be in place in the first quarter of 2002.""   Frank Dunn, =
the Company's new president and chief executive officer effective November =
1, 2001, said, ""Nortel Networks is focusing its investments and its organiz=
ation to drive continued leadership across three businesses: Metro Networks=
, which encompasses metro optical networking, IP networking, IP services an=
d voice over IP solutions for service providers and enterprises; Wireless N=
etworks; and Optical Long Haul Networks. In the quarter, our product progra=
ms continued to advance as we focused on building on our industry-leading p=
ortfolio of solutions. We also continued to work with our customers to help=
 them plan and deploy the solutions that will position them to drive reduct=
ions in their cost of operations and enable them to take advantage of oppor=
tunities for new revenue streams. Some key milestones over the past 120 day=
s included:         --  the First North American ILEC began the circuit to =
packet         transition with the deployment of our carrier-grade         =

all;     --  Introduced advances in IP solutions, including an integrated  =
       Layer 4-7 content switching capability on our Layer 2-3 Edge        =
 Switch Router; and     --  Completed hardware design, significantly advanc=
ed software         integration and began production of OPTera Connect HDX =
        solution.""    As announced on October 2, 2001, the Company expects =
to have an overall workforce of approximately 45,000 after the completion o=
f its work plan. Notifications to employees impacted by workforce reduction=
s are expected to be substantially completed by the end of October 2001. A =
workforce reduction and related charge will be recorded in the fourth quart=
er of 2001. Over the next few quarters, the Company also expects to continu=
e to divest non-core businesses in accordance with its work plan. The numbe=
r of positions which will be impacted by this divesture activity (including=
 the impact of divestures announced or completed to date) is expected to ul=
timately approach 10,000 positions.   Commenting on cash management in the =
quarter, Frank Dunn said, ""We are extremely pleased with the results that h=
ave been generated from our focus on cash management, which drove a signifi=
cant improvement in cash and contributed to positive cashflow from operatio=
ns. In addition, the Company further increased its financial flexibility by=
 completing a highly successful US$1.8 billion convertible debt issue which=
, combined with positive operating cash performance from continuing operati=
ons and a significant reduction in short term debt, has significantly enhan=
ced our strong liquidity position. Given the industry correction and action=
s we have taken over the last two quarters, Nortel Networks balance sheet i=
s well positioned.""   ""While we believe we are beginning to see early indic=
ations that capital spending by service providers is approaching sustainabl=
e levels, it still remains difficult to predict. In light of this and the u=
ncertainty regarding the potential impacts of events taking place in the wa=
ke of the September 11, 2001 tragedies and their effect on economies and bu=
sinesses around the world, we are not providing guidance for the fourth qua=
rter of 2001 or the full year 2002 at this time,"" concluded Dunn.         R=
evenue Breakdown from Continuing Operations    Network Infrastructure reven=
ues decreased 48 percent in the third quarter of 2001 compared to the third=
 quarter of 2000. Wireless Internet solutions grew substantially in Canada =
and slightly in Asia, which was more than offset by a considerable decline =
in Latin America, a slight decline in the United States and a decline in Eu=
rope. Optical Inter-city revenues were down sharply in the United States, E=
urope and Latin America, minimally offset by growth in Asia. Local Internet=
 revenues were down substantially in the United States, Europe, Canada and =
Latin America, which were minimally offset by an increase in Asia.   Photon=
ic Components segment revenues were down 93 percent in the third quarter co=
mpared to the same period last year. The sharp decline in the segment was l=
argely due to considerably lower sales of Nortel Networks Optical Inter-cit=
y solutions compared to the third quarter of 2000.   Other revenues decline=
d 29 percent in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Su=
bstantial growth in Global Professional Services in Europe and Asia, and st=
rong growth in the United States, was more than offset by considerable decl=
ines in legacy voice solutions for corporations across all regions and wire=
less OEM revenues in most regions.   Commensurate with its announcement on =
October 2, 2001 to align its resources around three businesses (Metro Netwo=
rks, Wireless Networks and Optical Long Haul Networks), Nortel Networks wil=
l evolve its financial reporting to reflect the new organization beginning =
in the fourth quarter of 2001.   Geographic revenues for the third quarter =
of 2001 compared to the same period in 2000 decreased 54 percent in the Uni=
ted States, 53 percent in Canada and 30 percent outside the United States a=
nd Canada.         Nine-Month Results    For the first nine months of 2001,=
 revenues from continuing operations were US$14.06 billion compared to US$1=
9.75 billion for the same period in 2000. Pro forma net loss from continuin=
g operations(a) for the first nine months of 2001 was US$4.01 billion, or U=
S$1.26 per common share, compared to pro forma net earnings of US$1.57 bill=
ion, or US$0.51 per common share on a diluted basis, for the same period in=
 2000. Including the net loss from discontinued access solutions operations=
, Acquisition Related Costs(a), stock option compensation from acquisitions=
 and divestitures, one-time gains and charges, and the write down of intang=
ible assets, Nortel Networks recorded a net loss of US$25.48 billion, or US=
$8.01 per common share, for the first nine months of 2001.         Spending=
 Management    The Company continued to make rapid progress to reduce its c=
ost structure. Compared to the Company's year-end 2000 cost structure, excl=
usive of incremental provisions and charges, the Company's cost structure a=
t the end of the third quarter of 2001 is lower by approximately US$1 billi=
on.         Gross Margin    Gross margin for the third quarter of 2001 was =
approximately 1 percent reflecting incremental charges of approximately US$=
750 million related to excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the exp=
ected decrease in sales due to the continued downturn in the market. Exclud=
ing the impact of these incremental and other contract-related charges, gro=
ss margin for the third quarter of 2001 was approximately 25 percent, compa=
red to approximately 26 percent in the second quarter of 2001.         Expe=
nses    Selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses in the third =
quarter of 2001 were US$1.92 billion. The continued impact of the market ad=
justments and further decline in some of our of customers' financial condit=
ion resulted in incremental provisions of US$767 million in the quarter rel=
ated to customer receivables and financings. Excluding the incremental prov=
isions in both periods, SG?expenses in the third quarter of 2001, compared =
to second quarter of 2001, were down by approximately US$190 million.   Res=
earch and development (""R&D"") expenses were US$808 million in the third qua=
rter of 2001. The R?expenses in the quarter reflected focused investments t=
o drive continued market leadership in our core businesses and the eliminat=
ion of spending in all other areas. Compared to the second quarter of 2001,=
 R? expenses in the third quarter of 2001 were down by approximately US$100=
 million, reflecting the impact of restructuring and streamlining operation=
s.   The financial results of Nortel Networks Limited(b) (""NNL""), Nortel Ne=
tworks Corporation's principal operating subsidiary, are fully consolidated=
 into Nortel Networks results. NNL has preferred shares which are publicly =
traded in Canada. For the third quarter of 2001, NNL took a restructuring c=
harge of US$793 million (pre-tax) associated with the completion of workfor=
ce reductions and the closure of certain facilities related to business str=
eamlining; and recorded US$207 million (pre-tax) primarily related to the a=
pproximately 50 percent reduction in manufacturing capacity of the Photonic=
s Components business. All such amounts are included in the consolidated No=
rtel Networks amounts described above.   Nortel Networks is a global leader=
 in networking and communications solutions and infrastructure for service =
providers and corporations. The Company is at the forefront of transforming=
 how the world communicates, exchanges information and profits from the hig=

 As a result of the reported net losses for the nine months         ended S=
eptember 30, 2001 and 2000, and the pro forma net loss         for the nine=
 months ended September 30, 2001, approximately         71, 162, and 71, re=
spectively, of potentially dilutive         securities (in millions) have n=
ot been included in the         calculation of diluted loss per common shar=
e for the periods         presented because to do so would have been anti-d=
ilutive.     (5) Excludes the impact of after-tax charges associated with  =
       discontinued operations, Acquisition Related Costs (in-process      =
   research and development expense and the amortization of         acquire=

1998), stock option compensation from         acquisitions and divestitures=
, and where applicable, certain         of the one-time gains and charges. =

ssociated with discontinued operations, Acquisition Related         Costs, =
stock option compensation from acquisitions and         divestitures, and o=
ne-time gains and charges. The loss from         discontinued operations wa=

laser         chip business. Stock option compensation from acquisitions an=
d         divestitures was $91. Cumulative effect of accounting change     =
    was a $24 pre-tax ($15 after-tax) gain. One-time gains were         $45=
 pre-tax ($21 after-tax) and one-time charges were $15,054         pre-tax =
($14,241 after-tax), primarily related to the write         down of intangi=

1236,allen-p,"Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

1237,allen-p,"A conference call was held today with FERC staffers to discuss items of interest or concern to us.  Participating for FERC were Bob Pease (enforcement att'y), Stuart Fisher (economist) and Bruce Poole (engineer).  Alan Comnes, Dave Perrino and I weighed in for Enron.  The laundry list of topics discussed is attached.  We expressed the sentiment that the root cause of all these issues and concerns is the current composition (and non-independence) of the ISO board, and suggested that the ISO board situation should be the subject of the upcoming FERC audit of ISO.  We went on to discuss the audit further and the fact that there is no established or formal comment process.  However, we were invited to file written comments with the Commission on what we thought should be audited, and Alan is taking the lead on this.  We will try to get others to sign on to the comments.  Some of the discussion items that the staff was highly interested in included:

	ISO request for a bid from us to prop up the price (staff requested a copy of the transcript).
	Any unexplained decreases in ATC (staff asked to be advised in real time).
	Information related to ISO OOM purchases (and whether they were declining).

All in all, it was a successful, informal call lasting about 40 minutes.  Staff was receptive to and agreed to receive periodic calls from us in the future.  This allows them to keep up with what is going on industry, and of course gives us an opportunity to educate and alert them on issues of interest to us.  Ray"

If there is anything worth reporting from the CDWR news
conference this morning, I'll send our report along--but it looks like
the state is backing away from renegotiating the DWR contracts
because it just realized gas prices are lower.

Subject:	Security Smart ID Tags-Off Property Usage


To remain consistent with Enron's directive to improve security access to the building, all Enron Body Shop members are required to check-in at the Body Shop Front Desk and present an Enron Photo ID badge or another form of Photo ID to the Security Officer each time you visit.  To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.  

The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit."
1242,allen-p,"Phillip,

I want to thank you for spending so much time with us today; I think we are
getting to a good level of detail and we accomplished a lot today. I left a
message for Ed and asked him to just focus on one or two difficult problems
because we are planning to also include some of your ""easy"" problems in the
simulation.

We will look forward to getting the outlines for the remaining four
scenarios from you early next week. Please let us know if something comes
up and you don't think you'll be able to work on them.

We'll call Ina with the room for next Friday. Thanks again for all your
help, and have a great weekend.
Mery

1243,allen-p,"I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow."

MEET THE DARK SIDE OF WINDOWS XP

    While I really like Microsoft's new operating
         system, there are still some issues that may

         other issues may make you want to skip XP entirely.
         Here are a dozen potential roadblocks to consider--don't
         upgrade before you read this!

  Question - Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA     Which two receivers should I=
 start this weekend, out of Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris Carter, Te=
rry Glenn and James McKnight? Who would you recommend starting out of Duce =
Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins?    Answe=
r - GG     As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must- start agai=
nst a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards a=
nd three touchdowns last weekend. Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously=
 not an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have t=
o go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so =
going with your most established player in this case is the best move. To a=
nswer your second question, we'd recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carol=
ina defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. It's tough to choose Davis, but=
 Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at=
 best, so our hands are tied.  =09


  Question - Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL     I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye th=
is week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weink=
e. What do you recommend?    Answer - GG     Miller has been very inconsist=
ent from a Fantasy perspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. He'll be =
facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players=
 like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a b=
ig game.  =09


  Question - Scott Buzby, Newark, DE     Who should I start this week: Shan=
non Sharpe or Bubba Franks?  Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin J=
ohnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still av=
ailable.    Answer - GG     Franks has been Brett Favre's favorite target i=
n the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sha=
rpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we hi=
ghly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his =
current pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he's just not =
good enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers=
 will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after an=
other No. 1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fa=
ntasy player.  =09


    Tip of the Week      Phil Brown, St. Louis, MO: When will people start =
giving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves? He is the best offensive optio=
n the Chiefs have, and he even has more rushing yards than Marshall Faulk a=
fter five weeks. With Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes=
 will continue to be a productive player all season.   =09

1256,allen-p,"Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Indigestion 
Daniel Fisher, Forbes Magazine, 10.29.01 

All those new natural gas-fired electric plants mean more gas demand, right? Maybe not.
For natural gas bulls, there was never a surer sign of good times to come than the order book at General Electric Corp. Backlogs in GE's Power Systems group almost tripled to $25 billion in the late 1990s as scores of utilities and freestanding power producers ordered natural gas turbines to supply the nation's growing appetite for electricity. Gas demand had to go up as all those shiny new turbines were connected to the grid. 

Ah, but there was a flaw in that argument--one that is becoming glaringly clear as the price of gas plunges below $2 per million Btu at the wellhead from as high as $10 last year. (A million Btu of gas equals just about 1,000 cubic feet.) Those new gas plants were supposed to steal business from pollution-spewing coal units, which still supply half the nation's electricity. But in a painstaking study of 788 power plants that supply the bulk of U.S. electricity, Charles Studness, president of Studness Research, found quite the opposite could happen. 

Studness determined that 79% of the ""new"" electricity supplied to the grid over the past five years came from existing plants, mostly coal-fired units. And there's plenty more where that came from. Studness figures existing coal plants have the potential to increase output by 50 million megawatt-hours a year for the next five years, representing about half the expected 2.5%-a-year increase in demand. 

Coal's advantage over gas: It's cheap. Utilities paid an average of $1.20 per million Btu for coal last year, compared with $4.30 for gas (delivered). Even with depressed gas prices, many coal plants are still cheaper to operate. So while those new turbines being installed by Calpine (nyse: CPN - news - people) and other independent power producers, (see table, below) will burn a lot of gas, they will do it mostly at the expense of older gas plants that burn half again as much. 

 
Addressing a Burning Issue 
If natural gas prices stay down or merely remain volatile it will help companies that burn, trade or store gas and hurt those that sell it or provide equipment to the industry. Overleveraged gas producers and service companies could have trouble making it through the downturn.  
  

WINNERS  			Sales* ($bil) 	Remarks 
Calpine 				$4.6 		Its gas power plants won't compete with coal for years 
Chesapeake Energy 		0.9 		Hedged gas production through December 2003 
Dynegy 			43.4 		Owns gas, coal power plants; stores, trades gas 
Peabody Energy 		2.7 		World's largest coal company 

LOSERS  			Sales* ($bil) 	Remarks 
Devon Energy 			3.3 Gas-heavy; 	$8 billion in ...debt  
General Electric 		129.5 		Sells gas turbines 
Pioneer Natural Resources 	1.0 		$1.5 billion in ...debt; 53% of production is gas 
Transocean SedcoForex 	1.9 		$4 billion in debt; heavy gas-drilling exposure 
   
*Latest 12 months. Source: Market Guide via FactSet Research Systems. 

""It's not our game to compete with coal or nuclear,"" says Ron A. Walter, senior vice president of San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine, which plans over the next few years to build gas-fired plants totaling 31,500 megawatts. ""It's our game to displace older gas."" 

Combined-cycle gas turbines, which use hot exhaust gases from one turbine to generate steam to turn a second one, can transform 6,800 Btu of gas into a kilowatt-hour of electricity, enough to light one lightbulb for ten hours. The oldest gas plants burn as much as 13,000 Btu, and the national average is 10,500. Substitute enough new plants for old, and U.S. gas consumption, currently 62 billion cubic feet a day, could drop by as much as 1 billion cubic feet a day. 

That scenario sounds unlikely to Stephen Bergstrom, president of Houston-based Dynegy, an energy-trading firm that also owns both coal- and gas-fired power plants. Dynegy's 35-year-old coal plants are ""huge capital hogs,"" Bergstrom says, that cost ten times as much to maintain as modern gas units. Throw in the cost of scrubbers and other required pollution controls, and many smaller coal plants will have to be shut down, Bergstrom says. 

But coal-plant owners can be ingenious. Witness Midwest Generation, a nonregulated subsidiary of Edison International that bought six coal plants from troubled Commonwealth Edison of Chicago in 1999. By changing operating procedures and burning a higher grade of coal, Midwest boosted output from the 40-year-old plants 12% last year--while reducing emissions. John Long, vice president and chief technical officer of the Midwest Generation unit, thinks he can coax another 15% increase out of those aging boilers over the next five years without running afoul of environmental rules. 

Long term, the bullish scenario still holds: Gas will displace coal. In the meantime, gas producers have a lot of bonds to retire."

ire via COMTEX/ -- American Express Company (NYSE: AXP) today reported thir=
d quarter net income of $298 million, down 60 percent from $737 million in =
the same period a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $.22, down 59 p=
ercent from a year ago. Net revenues on a managed basis totaled $5.5 billio=
n, down one percent from $5.6 billion a year ago. The company's return on e=
quity was 14.2 percent.   Results for the third quarter were negatively aff=
ected by two significant items: a previously announced restructuring charge=
 of $352 million pre-tax ($232 million after-tax) and the impacts from the =
September 11th terrorist attacks.   The September 11th events resulted in c=
ertain one-time costs and business interruption losses, including: provisio=
ns related to credit exposures to travel industry service establishments, i=
nsurance claims, and waived finance charges and late fees. The combination =
of these items totaled approximately $98 million pre-tax ($65 million after=
-tax).   The company also incurred costs of approximately $42 million since=
 September 11th, which are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequentl=
y, these costs did not impact the quarterly results. These include the cost=
 of duplicate facilities and equipment associated with the relocation of th=
e company's offices in lower Manhattan and certain other business recovery =
expenses. Costs associated with the damage to the company's offices, extra =
operating expenses and business interruption losses are still being evaluat=
ed. The company expects that a substantial portion ofgh its Ists and losses=
 will be covered by insurance.   The third quarter restructuring charge inc=
ludes severance costs for the elimination of approximately 6,100 jobs and a=
sset impairment and other costs, all relating to the consolidation and reor=
ganization of certain business units, the scale back of corporate lending i=
n certain regions, the migration of certain processes to lower cost locatio=
ns, the outsourcing of certain activities, and the transition of certain pr=
ocessing and service functions to the Internet. These initiatives are expec=
ted to produce expense savings of approximately $325 million in 2002. A por=
tion of these savings is expected to flow through to earnings in the form o=
f improved operating expense margins and the rest is expected to be reinves=
ted back into high-growth areas of the business.   In addition to the activ=
ities related to the restructuring charge, the company made strong progress=
 on its global reengineering efforts initiated in the first half of the yea=
r and, as of September 30, had realized savings in excess of $700 million. =
  Net income for the third quarter, adjusted for the restructuring and one-=
time costs related to September 11th, was approximately $595 million, down =
19 percent. On a similar basis, earnings per share were $.45, down 17 perce=
nt. The company's adjusted return on equity was 16.7 percent.   ""While we w=
ere on target to meet prior consensus for third quarter earnings, the terro=
rist attacks obviously had a significant impact on the overall economy and =
we saw clear evidence of that as consumer spending, business travel and inv=
estment activity slowed after September 11th,"" said Kenneth I. Chenault, ch=
airman and chief executive officer, American Express Company. ""In light of =
the weak economy and financial markets, we are moving aggressively to lower=
 our operating expenses. The progress we are making on our reengineering in=
itiatives has freed up substantial resources for investment in our business=
es with the strongest growth potential. This, along with the anticipated be=
nefit of lower interest rates and the strategies in place to grow our franc=
hise, positions us well to benefit when we see even a modest improvement in=
 the economy.""   Travel Related Services (TRS) reported quarterly net incom=
e of $248 million, down 51 percent from $507 million in the third quarter a=
 year ago. Included in third quarter results are $195 million pre-tax ($127=
 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Also include=
d in the results are $87 million pre-tax ($57 million after-tax) of one-tim=
e costs and waived fees directly related to the September 11th terrorist at=
tacks. Excluding these costs and the restructuring charge, TRS' net income =
would have been $432 million, down 15 percent from the third quarter last y=
ear.   TRS' net revenues rose two percent, as growth in loans and fee reven=
ues were partly offset by a three percent decline in billed business and a =
28 percent fall in travel sales. These declines reflect a substantial decre=
ase in corporate travel and entertainment spending and consumer travel sinc=
e September 11th. Prior to September, billed business growth for the quarte=
r was about two percent as higher consumer and small business spending offs=
et a decline in corporate travel and entertainment spending. Net finance ch=
arge revenues were higher, due to balance growth and wider net interest yie=
lds. This increase reflects a smaller percentage of loan balances on introd=
uctory rates and the benefit of declining interest rates during the quarter=
.   The provision for losses on the lending portfolios grew as a result of =
higher volumes and an increase in U.S. lending write-off rates and delinque=
ncies. Marketing and promotion expenses were lower as TRS scaled back certa=
in marketing efforts in light of the weaker business environment. Operating=
 expenses rose, reflecting increased Cardmember loyalty programs and busine=
ss volumes. These expenses were partly offset by the benefits of reengineer=
ing and cost-control efforts.   The above discussion presents TRS results ""=
on a managed basis"" as if there had been no securitization transactions, wh=
ich conforms to industry practice. The attached financials present TRS resu=
lts on both a managed and reported basis. Net income is the same in both fo=
rmats.   On a reported basis, TRS' results included securitization gains of=
 $29 million pre-tax ($19 million after-tax) and $26 million pre-tax ($17 m=
illion after-tax) in the third quarters of 2001 and 2000, respectively. The=
se gains were offset by expenses related to card acquisition activities and=
 therefore had no material impact on net income or total expenses.   Americ=
an Express Financial Advisors (AEFA) reported quarterly net income of $145 =
million, down 46 percent from $269 million in the third quarter a year ago.=
 Net revenues decreased 14 percent. Included in third quarter results are $=
62 million pre-tax ($41 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge note=
d earlier and $11 million pre-tax ($8 million after-tax) of insurance claim=
s directly related to September 11th. Excluding these items, AEFA's net inc=
ome would have been $194 million, down 28 percent from last year.   AEFA re=
sults reflect continued weakness in equity markets and narrower spreads on =
the investment portfolio. The weakened equity markets led to significantly =
lower asset levels and lower sales of investment products. As a result, man=
agement and distribution fees fell 15 percent.   Operating expenses, exclud=
ing the above-mentioned charges, decreased four percent from a year ago due=
 primarily to lower sales commissions and continued reengineering and cost-=
control initiatives.   As of September 30th, approximately 4 percent of the=
 company's $33 billion investment portfolio consisted of high-yield securit=
ies, down from 12 percent a year ago and 8 percent last quarter. The reduct=
ion reflects the activities to date to lower the risk profile of the portfo=
lio and concentrate on stronger credits.   American Express Bank (AEB) repo=
rted a quarterly net loss of $43 million, compared with $7 million of net i=
ncome a year ago. Included in third quarter results are $84 million pre-tax=
 ($57 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Excludi=
ng these charges, AEB's net income would have been $15 million, approximate=
ly double the earnings recorded in the same period last year.   While AEB s=
ustained damage to its premises due to the September 11th terrorist attacks=
, the costs are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequently, these co=
sts did not impact AEB's quarterly results.   AEB's business results reflec=
t strong performance in Personal Financial Services and Private Banking. Re=
sults also benefited from lower funding costs and lower operating expenses =
as a result of AEB's reengineering efforts. These were offset in part by hi=
gher provisions for losses due to higher Personal Financial Services loan b=
alances, and lower revenue from Corporate Banking as the company continues =
to shift its focus to Personal Financial Services and Private Banking.   Co=
rporate and Other reported net expenses of $52 million, compared with $46 m=
illion a year ago. Included in third quarter 2001 results are $11 million p=
re-tax ($7 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier.   =

    SUN, MICROSOFT AND THE ROAD TO THE 'FRICTION-FREE ECONOMY'

    The Internet and World Wide Web gave
    birth to an idea--a hyperefficient
    economy that operates less like a heat-producing
    mechanical engine and more like a motor
    coiled with a superconductor. To understand
    this basic idea is to understand Sun,
    Microsoft and their dueling ambitions
    for Web services.

  WHY INTEL COULDN'T MAKE ITS CONSUMER ELECTRONICS FLY

   Long the king of PC microprocessors, Intel
         thought it could rule the world of consumer
         electronics, too. Not so. Josh and John find
         Intel's decision to abandon consumer products
         disappointing, but not surprising.

Jeff:

I talked to your dad and he has mentioned that you might be interested in 
having our class build a shed for you.  We pretty much make whatever you 
would like to the specifications that you prefer. All of our buildings are 
durable and solidly constructed.  We build them in our shop and the ownner 
is rersponsible for their delivery.  There is no labor cost so you are only 
charged for the materials.

Our most popular size and style is the 8' x 12' barn . This is the most 
economical building that we construct and it is an easier one to haul to a 
given site. This building has an exterior of T-111 siding which is cedar 
style grooved exterior plywood which can be stained and sealed. We have 
usually build them with a 3'-10 1/2"" wide door opening.  I would think that 
would be wide enough for a four wheeler, but you would have to have your 
dad measure your vehicle to make sure.. We have probably built and sold 
over 30 of these in the past ten years. The price on this shed usually 
varies between $800 and $900.



Your dad also indicated an interest in a 10 x 12 gable style shed which is 
a bit bigger and ofcourse more expensive.  It has vinyl siding and aluminum 
soffit/overhang, I am attaching a picture of one we made for Joe 
Pronschinske.  This project is a bit harder to transport as it is oversize 
and legally you are  to obtain an oversize laod permit to haul it.   Your 
dad indicated that Joe would possibly haul it though.
The picture I am attaching shows a common 3' entry door.  We are presently 
building a structure for Nolan Goplin that has a overhead 6' wide roll up 
door.  The price on a 10' x 12' shed with a 6' wide roll-up door would be 
roughly $1500.


We will build either style and can modify the plans to meet your 
needs.  With the time we have left in the semester the 8 x 12 would be the 
easiest for us to build, but if you let me know right away, by Monday 
October 22, that you would like a 10 x12 size we would still be able to 
finish that one on time.

If you have any questions just e-mail me or call:
	Whitehall School Disctrict 715-538-4364
	My Home number 715-985-3063.

Have a good one and take with you later.

 - 3_6X01!.DOC"
1294,allen-p,"Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures.  No hand-outs were provided.

Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity
Topock  540 mmcf/d
Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d
Needles 800 mmcf/d
Wheeler 800 mmcf/d

New Receipt Points
Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d
Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d
Both will be available around Feb 1

Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation
Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.

New Calculation, Changes and Display
Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.

OFO Declaration
Name changes from overnomination
Can declare before any Cycle
Provide 2 hour notice
Post on Gas Select
Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select

Windows
Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system
Calculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.   
Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.  
Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's
Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.

Scheduling Changes-Nov 1
Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.     
Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle
Copy confirmed noms
All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.

2 Hour Notice
Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.
OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.  

Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO
Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.  
Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.
No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.
Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules
Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.
Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.  
If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.
Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.  
If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:

Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut
Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut
Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut
Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.  
For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.

For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:

         Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes
Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2
Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1
Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4
Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4

In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.

Winter Balancing Rules
Effective Nov 1-March 31
No changes.
All customers must comply.
Minimum delivery requirements
50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)
70% of daily usage depending on storage level
70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min
90% of daily usage depending on storage level
90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.
Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.
Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.
Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,

Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.

Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.  
Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group)
Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.

2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.

Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,
Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.

Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month.


OFO can be declared during undernom season (winter season)"

broad restructuring plan, as the retailer reported a 5.8% profit drop.

Eastman Kodak Co. announced plans to cut 4,000 jobs while reporting a 77%

WINDOWS XP URBAN LEGENDS AND MYTHS--DEBUNKED!

    As the clamor about Windows XP grows--it's
         being officially launched tomorrow--so
         does the confusion. I'll take a look at the
         most common misconceptions and questions
         about licensing, authorization, and compatibility
         and give you some answers.

    HOW WIN XP MARKS THE END OF THE PC'S PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE

    The debut of Windows XP could stand as
    an occasion more momentous than Microsoft
    itself anticipated. Reason: At the
    same time we're saying hello to the new
    OS, we could be saying goodbye to the
    Microsoft-Intel duopoly.

  WINDOWS XP JUST DOESN'T CUT IT IN THE SECURITY DEPARTMENT

   Like those cheesy all-in-one stereos from
         the '70s, the components in Windows XP are
         inferior to their standalone counterparts--especially
         when it comes to security. Robert points out
         the OS's security weaknesses, and tells you
         how to safeguard your computer.

  APPLE JUMPS INTO THE MP3 GAME--AND DOES IT RIGHT

   The just-unveiled iPod may have the distinction
         of being the first portable MP3 player to make
         the most of the genre. Stephan Somogyi investigates
         why this Mac peripheral might be worth a good

The below Analyst & Associate recruiting dates require ENA participation at Manager level at above.   In order to resource each of your departments it is important to have ENA's involvement and participation in the interviews and debrief sessions on Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday events.     These de-brief sessions will allow you the opportunity to select candidates you wish to join your groups.  The target  is to assign potential candidates to business units and departments from the outset.

As ENA has the highest percentage of A&A rotating in its business unit, the participation of ENA at interview should reflect this.     Therefore, please encourage your direct reports and managers to participate in the below events in order to secure candidates for your business area.


Associate Recruiting:		Saturday November 3						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview
Analyst Recruiting:		Friday, November 16						Total - 70 Candidates for Interivew
Associate Recruiting:		Saturday, December 1						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview

The above spreadsheet represents ENA's particpation today which I believe highlights the need for much additional support in these efforts.

Please confirm by return participation of your respective groups.

Regards,

Karen Buckley

Please review the two attachments below for final sign-off and Acceptance of this deliverable.

Phillip, you have approved these documents prior to Tim and my input reflected below, which primary consist of showing how the Knowledge system is connected to the simulation system (Tim's idea with some direct guidance from me to Accenture on how to reflect this in the flow chart). Thus it shows how the user can go to the knowledge system and get help during the simulation. This is reflected in the high level design flow chart.ppt

In addition, Accenture has added the following condition language to the High Level design. doc

	After sign-off on this document, the following things can be changed within the first two weeks of the content development phase:
?	Small story-line details (Example: company background, learner role)
?	Resources (reports and interviews) (Example: add a news article, remove a storage report)
?	Order and details of learner actions and decision (Example: add a sub-step where learner identifies the location of each risk; have the learner calculate net present value after choosing the best instrument rather than before)

Changes to any other High Level Design elements (Example: add a step where learner uses a pricing model to price a deal), or changes to anything after the first two weeks, will impact the budget and schedule. 


Issue: Do we agree to this condition. I recommend we agree. Although, we are in the content development phase the two week period begins from the time we accept this deliverable. I have confirmed this with Accenture and they will send another email with this change, but I do not want to hold up acceptance since we are on our clock. 

Thanks. Phillip, Tim & Yevgeny (if possible), please e-mail with your thumbs up or further input at your earliest convenience, but no later then COB 10/23.

Cheers
Kirk

1319,allen-p,"Greetings Phillip,

I received your phone message.  Thanks for the update.  I have been talking
with contractors and Spring Valley.  At this point we are trying to
determine whether the addition over the garage would be workable.  Heather
probably told you that I am meeting with a contractor on 11/7 at your home
to get a firm bid on the project.  I spoke today with the Spring Valley
building consultant and faxed him some detail.  There are a couple of
possible problems he is looking at and we'll possibly need to get a variance
from the decision makers when the time comes.

In the meantime, I printed out the earnest money contract and sellers
disclosure forms from the website you found.  We are waiting on the final
word from Spring Valley to move ahead.  I'll let you know when we have some
new information.

Thanks,

Bob Huntley

Bob,

I do have a survey of the sight at home.  I will get you a copy tomorrow.

Regarding contracts, the Texas Real Estate Commission website has copies of
the contracts we need.  The website is below.  I believe the relevant
contracts are form #20-4(One to Four Family Residential Contract) and form
#OP-H (Seller's Disclosure of Property Condition).  A coworker is about to
close on a home without using a broker and these are the forms he used.

THE 10 TOP THINGS YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT WIN XP

    Reams have been written about XP. I've gone
         on and on about it myself. But now it's officially
         here, what's left to say? Not much, but just
         this: A list of the few features and issues

    XP: PHOOEY ON YOUIE! WHY IPOD IS THE APPLE OF OUR EYES TODAY

    Apple poured some precipitation on
    Microsoft's XP-week parade by introducing
    its new MP3 player. But the iPod isn't
    just some mischief at Microsoft's expense.
    Instead, it's a product that embodies
    Apple at its very best and makes you wonder:
    Is Apple underestimating itself by
    not making more things for the rest of
    us?

In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

1335,allen-p,"Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work."

I checked with my director (Pam Butler) on your question about recouping taxes already paid.  It is my understanding that you cannot recoup these taxes.

Thanks,

Renee

Subject:	RE: Distribution Form


Renee,

Thank you for the forms.  I am trying to estimate my tax obligation.  It is my understanding that the account balance will be treated as ordinary income.  What about Social Security and Medicare taxes?  I thought those were already deducted.  Also, the are no earnings on the deferrals I have made.  On the contrary, there are losses.  Is it possible to recoup any taxes paid?

Thanks for you help.

Phillip

In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525."

Good day. I hope all is going well. 

If I do not hear from you by COB tomorrow I will take your silence as acceptance and that their are no non-conformities to prevent acceptance of this deliverable. In addition, this includes the condition of what we can change for the two week period following acceptance (see below). This action is necessary as contractually we are coming to the end of the acceptance period for this deliverable. 

Good news is that this deliverable and the Topic Framework deliverable are the last two deliverables for the Design Phase of the project. Thanks

Cheers
Kirk

Subject:	Revised High Level Design-Sign-off for Acceptance

Phillip/Tim/Yevgeny
Please review the two attachments below for final sign-off and Acceptance of this deliverable.

Phillip, you have approved these documents prior to Tim and my input reflected below, which primary consist of showing how the Knowledge system is connected to the simulation system (Tim's idea with some direct guidance from me to Accenture on how to reflect this in the flow chart). Thus it shows how the user can go to the knowledge system and get help during the simulation. This is reflected in the high level design flow chart.ppt

In addition, Accenture has added the following condition language to the High Level design. doc

	After sign-off on this document, the following things can be changed within the first two weeks of the content development phase:
?	Small story-line details (Example: company background, learner role)
?	Resources (reports and interviews) (Example: add a news article, remove a storage report)
?	Order and details of learner actions and decision (Example: add a sub-step where learner identifies the location of each risk; have the learner calculate net present value after choosing the best instrument rather than before)

Changes to any other High Level Design elements (Example: add a step where learner uses a pricing model to price a deal), or changes to anything after the first two weeks, will impact the budget and schedule. 


Issue: Do we agree to this condition. I recommend we agree. Although, we are in the content development phase the two week period begins from the time we accept this deliverable. I have confirmed this with Accenture and they will send another email with this change, but I do not want to hold up acceptance since we are on our clock. 

Thanks. Phillip, Tim & Yevgeny (if possible), please e-mail with your thumbs up or further input at your earliest convenience, but no later then COB 10/23.

Cheers
Kirk

We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.

What is going on down the street?  Curious to hear any perspectives you may
wish to offer from the trading floor?  Enron stock is now lower than when I
joined the company out of business school.  I imagine there are quite a few
not so happy people these days.  We can relate somewhat over here at NPW
with a stock at around $1.25 (in fact we broke $1 a few days ago).  Knowing
you, I do not imagine you are letting any of these events get you down
much.  I have taken a similar approach to our problems here at NPW.

Hope everything else is going well for you and the family.  Have you had
the knee surgery yet?  Give me a call when you have a chance.

    Apple is hardly immune from the slowdown

    the rebates to prove it. The company
    is giving cash back--or free toys--to
    anyone who buys its computers from now
    through December, borrowing a tactic
    from its PC-selling brethren. But is
    it too little, too late?

   At a recent tech conference, Microsoft's

  Question - Chris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI     I am stuck on my last starter.  Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty  Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he  is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should  be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the  season.    Answer - GG     Alexander has been a revelation in his first two  starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to  him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not  be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and   Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who  may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker  will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not  destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a  great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score  a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a  Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems.  	


  Question - Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA     Should I start Rod Gardner or  Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is  looking better each week.    Answer - GG     Gardner's huge day means two things. One, he gains  instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be  geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The  Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of  the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is  quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants'  No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing  Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week.  Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with  Hilliard because of his experience and continuing  improvement.  	


  Question - John Kersey, Denver, CO     I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB -  Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson?    Answer - GG     Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but  the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in  him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas  after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a  respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a  Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against  the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with  the hotter player, and that would be Thomas.  	


    Tip of the Week      Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is  a game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions  override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in  the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the  Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle.  And in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be  surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh.

1388,allen-p,"[IMAGE]  Market  Insight for December 24, 2001  From    [IMAGE]    The  Gl=
obal Online Financial Services Firm  Please  note, the Market Insight will =
not be published next week. Have a safe and happy holiday season!     Deadl=
ine for Converting to a Roth IRA  December 31, 2001 is your deadline for co=
nverting a Traditional  IRA to a Roth IRA. You should consult with a tax pr=
ofessional  or accountant to help you determine if a conversion is advantag=
eous  for you. For assistance, please call 1-800-934-4448, press  4 then 4 =
to speak with a Retirement Plans Specialist.  Restraints  Will Be Overcome =
 We see an  irregular upward trend in the market.  Stocks  face some formid=
able hurdles. The risk of additional terrorism  and fresh memories of the m=
arket's 18-month downward spiral are  inhibiting buying. So are dismal four=
th-quarter earnings pre-announcements  as the economic cycle approaches bot=
tom, as well as continued  high P/E ratios on recession-depressed profits. =
In addition, the  supply of stock for sale at prices just above current lev=
els is  heavy, according to technical analysts.   But  we expect that these=
 and other impediments will be overcome. And  we note that market recoverie=
s that proceed in halting fashion  amid widespread skepticism often are the=
 most sustainable.  Congress's  failure to pass a fiscal stimulus bill is n=
ot a major negative,  according to S&P chief economist David Wyss. The econ=
omy will  recover anyway, says Wyss, with absence of the package pinching  =
GDP growth in 2002 by only 0.2%. Without fiscal stimulus, the  chances of a=
 12th fed funds rate cut on January 30 are improved.    Based  on Wyss's fo=
recast of GDP turning positive in the first quarter  and improving to an an=
nual growth rate of 5% in the fourth quarter,  investors should be getting =
more encouraging news before long.    The  recent rally lost upward momentu=
m when it bumped up against overhead  resistance at 1170 on the S&P 500 on =
December 5. With the  help of turn-of-the-year reinvestment demand, the nex=
t attempt  to work through this supply is likely to be more successful, say=
s  Mark Arbeter, S&P chief technical analyst. But even if it  is, the area =
of resistance runs all the way up to 1313, so Arbeter  believes further pro=
gress in the period ahead will be labored.    We  think the S&P 500 and Nas=
daq will see double-digit gains over  the course of 2002. A portfolio alloc=
ation of 65% stocks, 20%  bonds and 15% cash reserves remains appropriate. =

The modified version of the GTC will be available on EnronOnline all week, next week for any customers wishing to have their legal departments review it before they accept it.

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications.

I need to get the contract for Galaxy and Grande executed today. In addition
I will need to close the loan at the title company in Hays County this week.
If you elect me vice-president of Bishops Corner, Inc., I can take care of
all of the documents.  From a logistics standpoint this probably would be
the best way to handle it.

Please let me know today if possible so I can send them to the lender.

HAPPY HOLIDAYS! (AND WHERE TO GET HELP IN A PINCH)

    The week between Christmas and New Year's
         is traditionally vacation time in Silicon
         Valley, so we're taking the week off, too.
         In the meantime, here are some places you can
         get computer help over the holidays. And if
         you really, really miss me, I've also linked
         to my most popular columns of 2001.

    HO, HO, HO! WHY CHRISTMAS 2002 WILL BE JOLLY, BY GOLLY

    While this is a muted Christmas for most
    of us, it's been a merry one indeed for
    e-tailers. Pat thinks that if this holiday
    generated so much holiday cheer, just
    wait 'til next year. That's when some
    enabling technologies will make online
    shopping far more than the glorified
    catalog-buying experience it is now.

  WHY YOU'RE STILL NOT GIVING CUSTOMERS WHAT THEY WANT

   The Internet promised to make ""mass customization""
         a reality. But so far it hasn't worked out that
         well. Reason: It's simply too costly. But
         is there some way your business can create
         tailor-made goods for even broad markets?
         Adrian thinks so--but it's going to be tricky.

  BUILDING AN E-GOVERNMENT: IT'LL BE HARD, BUT IT'LL HELP IT

   Will the government ever go paperless? It
         looks like in 2002 it might start. Such an undertaking
         would boost government spending and give
         tech businesses a much-needed shot in the
         arm. But it won't be easy. Larry explains why
         it'll be so challenging to bring the government
         into the wired world.

1417,allen-p,"Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com"

  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Plan for the Playoffs   ? Game-by-Game Analysis   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.  	


    Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Mike Blake     I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten?    Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad.  	


  Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    Answer - GG     Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.   	


  Question - Chris Gilcrest     Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?     Answer - GG     Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore.   	


    Tip of the Week      Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay  healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his  solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to  another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best  Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an  unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.

[IMAGE]  =09 2002 Toyota Camry XLE:  Best-Selling Style and Refinement     =
 The Toyota Camry casts a long shadow on the U.S. car market. It was  intro=
duced back in 1983 as a boxy hatchback and sedan that quickly became  known=
 for its eminent practicality and bulletproof reliability. Subsequent  gene=
rations became larger and more powerful, with the Camry line expanding  to =
include a wagon and a coupe. Toyota designed it to appeal to as many  buyer=
s as possible, and buyers responded by making the Camry one of  America's b=
est-selling vehicles.   For 2002, the Camry has been completely redesigned =
on a brand-new platform.  The new generation is being sold solely as a four=
-door sedan, although last  year's Camry Solara continues as a coupe and co=
nvertible. Toyota claims  that the new Camry's design is both sportier and =
more personal than the  sedans that came before. We evaluated a Camry XLE t=
o find out if Toyota hit  its mark.      Full  Review   > >      You are  r=

10 COMDEX PRODUCTS YOU NEED TO SEE (AND CAN)

    I couldn't possibly do justice to all the things
         I saw at Comdex in the 600 words that make up
         my column. But since pictures are worth a thousand
         words--and video even more--I'm still able
         to give you a good glimpse of 10 products that
         are well worth watching.

 Anticipated By Arnie Kaufman, Editor, The Outlook   We see further  but sl=
ower market progress.  Tired  after their recent run, stocks nevertheless a=
re being supported  by signs that the economy is stabilizing, better news f=
rom Afghanistan  and a large pool of cash reserves earning meager returns. =
The  two-steps-forward, one-step-backward recovery since September  21 hasn=
't created the enthusiasm that would necessitate an early,  nasty correctio=
n. Investors, keeping in mind that every rally  of the past 19 months has u=
ltimately failed, are regaining their  confidence only slowly.  Background =
 conditions don't lend themselves to a strong advance in the near  term. Wh=
ile recent data suggest that the recession will be mild  and will end early=
 next year, risks to this forecast are high.  Another terrorist attack coul=
d deepen consumer gloom. The possibility  of the disruption of oil supplies=
 still exists. The fiscal stimulus  package continues to be bogged down in =
partisan bickering.   Treasury  bond yields, moreover, have turned sharply =
higher, spurred by  the less dire economic reports and by chart breakouts. =
Yields  have quickly retraced the September-October decline.  S&P  technica=
l analyst Mark Arbeter is impressed by the recent stock  market action and =
anticipates higher levels over the intermediate  term, but he believes the =
easiest and quickest gains are behind.  Arbeter sees a likely substantial a=
mount of stock for sale when  Nasdaq (currently at 1898) moves into the 192=
0 to 2300 range and  the S&P 500 (now at 1139) reaches 1170 to 1300. He exp=
ects  it will take time to chew through this supply.  History  also suggest=
s limited near-term upside potential. Three months  after the low points of=
 the nine postwar bear markets, the S&P  500 was up an average of 14.9%. Th=
e index is already up 18% since  the September 21 low. Six months after the=
 nine postwar bear market  lows, however, the ""500"" showed an average gain =
of 24.4%;  12 months after the lows, the index was ahead 34.5%, on average.=

1440,allen-p,"GMAT REVIEW AT ENRON

The next GMAT review course at Enron will begin Monday, November 26th:
The schedule is:
     Course # 7019-00:  Monday nights, Nov 26 - Jan 28 (no class Dec 24 or
Dec 31)

This course is identical to the courses that started in October.  It is
being offered now for the benefit of employees who would like to take the
GMAT before January 31 for the purposes of applying to business school.

Course details:
     - Class is held at Enron in room ECN560 and is restricted to Enron
		employees
     - Each course is limited to eight students
     - Meets once a week for eight weeks
     - Hours are 6:00-9:00 PM (first session will run til 10:00 pm to
          include initial exam)
     - Expect 4-5 hours of homework per week
     - Course includes a total of four practice GMAT exams
     - Ends the second week of December, allowing employees to take the
          GMAT in December and meet a January application deadline.
     - Special discount of $200 off the regular Princeton Review tuition

Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for
convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their
own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is
subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and
relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
     1.  Print out the attached registration form.
     2.  Complete the form, but please note the following
          SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
          A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
               your email address.
          B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says ""Please enroll
               me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________"",
          C.  In the Payment section:  For the course at Enron, the
               tuition is discounted by $200, to $899.
               FULL PAYMENT of this amount by credit or debit card is
required on the registration form.  Be sure to indicate complete cardholder
information.
     3.  Fax the completed form to Princeton Review at (713) 688-4746.

Faxes are time-stamped by the receiving fax machine at Princeton Review.
The first eight valid registration forms received for each course will be
honored.  Registrations received after the first eight will be placed on a
waiting
list for the course or courses indicated.  Enrollments and waitlists will be
confirmed by email.

Employees who are not able to take the course at Enron can take a course at
the Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount.  
Call (800)2REVIEW to register or to receive a list of course schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

1441,allen-p,"Thanks.  That is an interesting idea.  I'd like to keep the rear stairway
but that might still be possible.  Anyway, let's see what happens with the
variance.  I appreciate your efforts.

By the way, did you have any problems with any of the neighbors?

Bob,

I turned in the application for a variance yesterday.  The hearing will be
on January 8th.  In order to get on the calendar for the Dec 4th hearing,
the application had to be in by November 9th.  I was under the impression
that yesterday was the deadline.  Sorry if I dropped the ball.

On another note, I spoke to Joe Edwards yesterday and he had some useful
suggestions about the addition.   It might be possible to move the addition
forward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the new
space.  You could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and use
the new space for your game/play/music room.  Then you could close off the
existing play room to replace the bedroom lost.  Part of the play room that
is bordered by the stair rail and looks down to the living room could be
used for a built in desk with a couple of computers.  This way you would
not have to add a second staircase.  The walls needed to convert the
playroom to a bedroom should be minor construction.  In the back you could
slope the roof until you were within the setback.  Then you could place a
large dormer facing the back of the property or bring a wall straight up.
>From the driveway the addition would have the same elevation as your
drawing but intwould be brought forward with a covered parking area below
the addition.  The kitchen and dining room windows would still open to the
driveway but they would be more shaded.  That is the west side of the house
so that might not be a bad thing.  Your ideas about opening up the kitchen
to the living room or dining room would still be possible.  Personally, I
think opening the dining room would be the better idea.

I don't know if you can visualize this or if you are even interested in
exploring anything except your original plan.  But I wanted to suggest
something in case the variance was not granted.  Let me know if you want me
to try and sketch out these ideas.

1443,allen-p,"I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

HOW TO PICK AN ALL-IN-ONE: IT'S THE FORM FACTOR, STUPID

    I'll say it straight up: There's no perfect
         device (yet) that combines a cellular phone
         and a PDA. So finding one you can live with is
         always a trade-off. My advice? Choose form
         factor first and live with the compromises.
         (Or just stick with separate gadgets.)

    Thanksgiving Football     Remember that two NFL games will be played on Thursday: Packers vs. Lions at 12:30 PM ET and Broncos vs. Cowboys at 4:05 PM ET. Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from these four teams on your roster, they must have their final status (active or reserve) set 5 minutes before the start of their game. Please keep in mind that you also will not be able to enter any new add/drops for the week starting one hour prior to Thursday's first kickoff. Football Commissioner players, check with your league's commissioner to see how your lineup deadline is handled this week.  	


    Sortable Standings     Did you know that every column on your Standings page is sortable? Click the category name at the top of any column to sort the report by the results of that category. In head- to-head leagues, the Standings report is displayed in order of the teams with the best win/loss percentage. However, you can click the PF (Points For) column to display the top point-scoring teams at the top; or the PA (Points Against) column to display, in descending order, the teams with the most fantasy points scored against them.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Marcus Howell     Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese  at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego?    Answer - GG     Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries  this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle  injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been  bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer  seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But  remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has  never been able to string many good performances together in  the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be  primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by  Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post  respectable numbers at Dallas.  	


  Question - Eric Fernau     Which three running backs should I start?  I  have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest  Holmes and Garrison Hearst.    Answer - GG     Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is  facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but  will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside.  Staley should have little trouble ripping through the  Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at  Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon,  Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.  	


  Question - Jay Rassat     Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have  Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they  play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).    Answer - GG     Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and  each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play.  Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of  a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady.  With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew  Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New  England QB.  	


    Tip of the Week      Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to not  have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for  people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be  surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky's a  great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a  back like Alexander.

UNLUCKY 13: MY TOP TECH TURKEYS OF ALL TIME

    It is sad that a fowl so noble--not to mention
         savory--has come to symbolize lame thinking
         and laughable losers. But alas, it has. And
         so in honor of our national holiday I've assembled
         a list of things that, well, I can't be thankful
         for. Once I've given you mine, why don't you
         give me yours?

    GET READY TO SHOP... MS'S NEUKOM DEPARTS... FBI LISTENING IN...

    It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas...well,
    at least in the shopping malls, and probably
    at your favorite online stores, too.
    This holiday season, the biggest retail
    names are putting extra effort into
    making their online shops as good as
    their offline ones--and, unlike past
    years, in making your experience there
    as pleasurable as possible.

  BEST STUFF IN THE 'DIGITAL DECADE' WILL BE BEHIND
  THE SCENES

   Which technologies will matter most in the
         next ten years? Not XP, Xbox, or the Tablet
         PC. Try Office and back-end Web services.
         It may not sound sexy, but it'll help you get
         work done. Eric has the story.

  GET A STEAL ON A CELL PHONE THAT'LL KEEP YOU IN CONTACT(S)

   If you fumble with your PDA every time you make
         a call, you need a cell phone that manages your
         contacts. A lot of high-end phones do this,
         but they're pricey. Janice finds an affordable
         phone that fits the bill.

1477,allen-p,"As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period."

    It's the coolest thing many people say they've

         on it. And here's my plan for Steve Jobs' foray

    MS TO SETTLE?... LINUX PDA SHIPS... OPEN SOURCE FACES REALITY...

    Microsoft may settle! Again! This time,
    it could get out of a slew of private antitrust
    suits by donating software to schools.
    A good cause, no doubt. But does that
    really make up for its legal violations?

  HOW HACK ATTACKS ARE GETTING SMARTER--AND HARDER
  TO STOP

   Malicious users are learning to better outsmart
         their captors, a new report says. They're
         using hard-to-detect worms to carry out denial-of-service
         attacks, and targeting routers that could
         bring down whole portions of the Internet.
         What should you watch out for? Robert has the

1484,allen-p,"Good morning,

In an effort to smooth out some of the problems we have seen in the past, I would like to start getting a P&L estimate from each of you nightly to try to prevent any unnecessary surprises in the mornings.  I will then expect my group to contact you before they leave at night if it is above or below your estimates, or range you give them.  

This will certainly help us all avoid any fire drills the next day. 

If you have any concerns about this please let me know, otherwise, your book admins will be calling you or stopping by your desks around 3:00 daily to get this estimate. 

Thanks,

Mike & Tony,

Rather than fill in the design selections, I have attached a spreadsheet that estimates the costs.  Since I have spent so much time researching the house, I think my numbers are pretty close.  

I would be interested in working with a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee basis.  I don't know if this would be agreeable to you.  Take a look at the numbers and let me know what you think.  If we could work together on this basis, I will complete the design selections.  I will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors.

We are torn between two good locations.  However, we are leaning towards Kerrville.  The lot in Kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in San Marcos, so we are really stretched to make this house work financially.  We have decided that if we can make Kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead, if not we will fall back to  our plan to move to San Marcos.  

I don't know how many jobs you have going currently, but if we could reach an agreement we would like to start immediately.

David,

For clarity, wherever you cite Section 6.2 in your response I assume you mean Section 6.3.  

Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan.  The beginning of Section 6.3 states ""Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?"".   This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution.  I disagree with your translation of ""a single sum distribution"" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount.  I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L.   In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1.  This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares.  Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value.  This is the methodology described in Section 7.1.

Tom Martin and Scott Neal share the above concerns.  Please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further.

For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.  

Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.

Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.  

      Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan."

ecause of the holiday,  31% of the bear market loss from March 27, 2000 to =
September 21,  2001 had been recaptured. That's about average for rebounds =
in  the postwar period. As shown in the table at the bottom right  of this =
week's edition of The Outlook, at the two-month point  in the recoveries fr=
om the nine former bear markets since World  War II, the S&P 500 had won ba=
ck an average of 33% of the  bear market loss.   In  each of the nine insta=
nces, the gain at the end of six months  was greater than that after two mo=
nths and the gain at the end  of 12 months was greater than that after six =
months. On average,  nearly two-thirds of the bear market loss was recovere=

 a year.  Economic  and corporate news will remain bad for a while, but tha=
t's typically  the case in the early part of a bull market that is associat=

with the start of an economic expansion in the first  quarter of next year.=
   While  P/E ratios currently are high, that won't necessarily keep the  b=

s far greater than  proved justified. Those excesses are now being correcte=
d, painfully.  Corporate earnings are in a severe contraction. Once the eco=
nomy  begins to grow again, however, profits will rebound and P/Es will  st=

Kirk -

In regards to your response to move these reviews up and hopes to get the
ball rolling before Monday, November 26th - I will be sending you three
messages following this with the drafts of five topics that are ready for
SME review.
1) Options and Futures for Dutch Quigley
2) Forwards and Swaps for Andy Lewis
3) Organizational Structure for Berney Aucoin

I hope sending them in this manner will make it easier for you send to
Phillip and ultimately, the SMEs.

Our goal is to send you the following topics by EOD tomorrow:
1) Risk Identification and Commodity Fundamentals for Ed McMichael
2) Risk Management Inputs and Hedging Basics for Mark Reese

Reminder that Accounting & Reporting will be written by Errol McLaughlin
(from Jeff Gossett's group) and will not be complete until mid-December.

As far as storyline scripts are concerned, I am unable to send anything to
you prior to the EOD tomorrow. Unfortunately, our script writer can not get
them to us any sooner. Hopefully you can forward them to Legal for them to
see first thing Monday morning. I apologize for not being able to get them
to you sooner.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Good afternoon Kirk -

As a reminder, the following are upcoming reviews we will need from Enron.

**Scripts for Storyline Video:  These scripts will be ready for Enron Legal
to review first thing Monday morning after the holidays - Nov. 26th. Based
on our production shoot schedule and reserving the actors/actresses, we
would like these reviews completed by EOD Wednesday, but can have them no
later than EOD Thursday.  As I've mentioned before, these scripts should
not take more than two hours to review. Please let me know if there are any
issues with this timeframe as it will significantly impact our schedule as
well as the production house and hired actors/actresses' schedules. Thank
you.

Topic Content for the Knowledge System: We will have all but one of the
topics ready for SME review/edits first thing Monday morning - Nov. 26th.
As we discussed, I am hoping you can send these to Phillip for him to
forward on to the SMEs. We will be sending these topics to the following
SMEs for their review and edits.
     Risk Identification - Ed McMichael
     Commodity Fundamentals - Ed McMichael (waiting on one homework
assignment from him)
     Futures - Dutch Quigley
     Options - Dutch Quigley
     Swaps - Andy Lewis
     Forwards - Andy Lewis
     Risk Management Inputs - Mark Reese
     Hedging Basics - Mark Reese
     Organization Structure - Berney Aucoin (we are still missing content
for Mid-Marketer/Origination)

The last topic, Accounting and Reporting, will be developed later in the
process as Errol McLaughlin will be helping us write this througout the
first two weeks in December. Berney Aucoin will need to review this.

MY 2001 FAVORITES: PRODUCTS I COULDN'T DO WITHOUT

    One of the perks of my job is getting to play
         with lots of neat new gizmos. During the past
         year, I tried out dozens of different devices.
         But when it comes right down to it, there's
         only a handful that really made a difference
         for me. Here's what they are, how they work,
         and why I like them so much.

    WELCOME AT&T COMCAST... XP HOLE PLUGGED... CRACKERS UNDER
FIRE...

    Say hello to the new cable king: AT&T
    Comcast. That's right. Comcast beat
    out AOL Time   Warner and Cox in the contest
    for AT&T Broadband's hand in marriage.
    The cable giant is out   to dominate not
    only the cable-modem and TV worlds,
    but also the local telephone service
      realm. Watch out, Baby Bells!

   WHY IT'S A GREAT TIME TO BE A MAC AND MUSIC LOVER

   First, Apple gave us the iPod, perhaps the
         best MP3 player ever. Now comes a new version
         of its iTunes digital jukebox software, which
         really takes the cake. Josh and John tell you
         why these Apple products--and a slew of other
         gizmos to pass through ZDNet Labs this week--scored
         so well with our editors.

   HOW TO MASTER WINDOWS (AT LEAST WHERE YOU CAN)

   You can't fix all of Windows' idiosyncrasies,
         but you can at least control how it behaves
         when it starts up and shuts down. Preston recommends
         three downloads that let you choose which
         programs load when you boot up, as well as set
         tasks--such as ejecting a CD--for each time
         you power down.

1516,allen-p,"Phillip,


It will go along this lines: (Conservative)

*****************************************************
We pay ""0"" going forward
We have already played 300K in 3Q2001
Outstanding bill for $27,740 will hit Enron Q1, 2002

Enron and surviving entity will have the right to use it internally

We value Enrons SME time @ around 300K

Accenture will have the right to use it internally and modify the product at its will for internal & external use.

This arrangement will void 900K Enrons Revenue from Accenture

Enron would receive 0% royalty on all external sales.  I was thinking to stay away from royalty as we do not know what will be new company position on this matter. Also,  I do not think Accenture will want to enter into partnership structure with a ghost company unless we get Dinergy involved.

***********************************************************************

If we do not reach the agreement: 1. Terminate and pay around 500-600k (estimate)  The payment could be deferred in to 2Q 2002 or
				 2. Continue ""as is"" with payment differed for 90 days or merger.

We are sending Accenture official notice as of tomorrow we have 10 business days to workout solution or terminate.	

Any comments or suggestions?

Importance:	High

Phillip,

I am following up to our BRM conversation from Friday.  Obviously it is a valid questions to ask and as you requested I am attaching two documents: one summarizing the options and  2nd cash flow impact.  In the cash flow impact Case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost.  (it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cut in sim exercises 50K)  The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you. A total of two sims could be cut one.  Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting.  Also,  I will ask them to cut the meeting by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions.  I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around. 

Obviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time.  We will continue to review how to cut labor and expenses.
One question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is as follow.  Is BRM ""core"" to the Enron for next few months or new organization?  Please consider the costs of finishing this project.


Sincerely,


Yevgeny Frolov

1517,allen-p,"Phillip,

Here are the key points that came out of today's meeting:

1. We will move Conversion and Arbitrage from the Simulation layer into the
Knowledge System layer. We will incorporate 5-10 problems of each type.

2. You will provide us with the name(s) of people who can give us content
for these problems. We will set up two rounds of meetings; one early next
week to gather content and a second meeting for review.

3. We will change ""Gas Daily Risk"" to ""Intra-Month Risk"" throughout the
simulation. Can you provide us with a definition of Intra-Month risk?

4. Just to clarify: For conversion, we were planning to cover problems
where there is no perfect hedge so the learner has to find creative ways to
hedge, as opposed to conversion of mmBTU to decatherms, conversion of oil
volumes to natural gas volumes, etc. Is that what you had in mind too?

Thank you in advance for your help. Have a great Thanksgiving.
Mery

1526,allen-p,"To all of our esteemed & prized Internet Banking  (IBS) Clients:

You probably have begun to wonder does anyone ever return phone calls
(or e-mails). We really do but have been holed up trying to complete
this project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we
found that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our
users back on-line.

We have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked
your additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This
process was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100
IBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and
confidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying
data and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of
you (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than
once or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want
displayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or
phone) the information to us and we will remove this information right
away.

To our IBS Billpayer clients:

During this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill
payment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring
payments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our
highest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the
process of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this
information. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the
months of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence
(and support).

Again, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and
ourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be
one of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account
information, please refer to the following information:

1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was
the correct password) and been given the error message ""You have failed
to correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or
contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset."" This is
the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you

Legal is now reviewing the scripts we will need for this video shoot.

This timeframe communicated below is NOT applicable for the Enron experts
who will be filming expert stories. The video shoots for the Enron Expert
Stories will be held December 10th and 11th and Ann Chen will be working on
this (I have forwarded her your response below). However, I agree with your

FYI

Sheri
The 3 SME's that have already committed to being on film need to be keep in
the lope regarding the timeline. Also check with these 2 SME's for
additional candidates (i.e. check with Mark Reese to see if Lamar Frazier
would be interested). I would like to be conferenced in on the media calls
& meetings. Also cc me on their emails or forward to me  their  emails.
This will keep me in the loop. Thanks

Thank you for helping us work towards sign-off from Enron Legal. Seeing as
you haven't been closely involved, I thought you'd like an update on our
media production tasks.

As you know, we are completing our planning phase for the production of the
storyline scripts. Our media vendor, Cramer, has been extremely helpful and
enjoyable to work with.  Below is an email from Steve, the director for our
storyline video, explaining where we are in the production process.

Have a good day!

Hey Sheri,
I hope you had a great Thanksgiving! I can't believe it's over
already! Anyway...we've shuffled the schedule around, securing the 6th and
7th of
December for the shoot in the studio. We're working on finalizing the
edit dates to reflect that shift. Chris is moving to hold all talent for
those dates.

I guess it's now in the hands of legal! As soon as we confirm the edit
suite
availability
we'll revise and post the new schedule. We're scheduled for our weekly call
tomorrow but if
anything comes up just give me a buzz!
Thanks Sheri!
Steve

Hello Steve and Chris -

Recently, there were changes to the overall number of our scenarios in our
simulation. There will be seven scenarios versus the nine we have been
discussing. These changes result in:
        Deletion of 2 intro and 2 exit videos
        Deletion of six interview questions (see more detail below)
        No additional characters. We will still need all characters (and
        talent) that we have casted for.

Laura has been working with John to make the required edits to the scripts.
We have recieved today (mid-day).

Based on our last discussion, I'd like to recommend we set the date for our
shoot for the end of the first week in Dec. Specifically, Dec. 6th and 7th.
This recommendation is based on the response I received from our project
manager in regards to the time it will take to have Legal review our
scripts.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you and have a
wonderful Thanksgiving!

1530,allen-p,"For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.  

Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.

Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.  

      Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan."

Subject:=09FW:=20


Greg,

After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de=
ferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg=
arding the Phantom Stock Account. =20

Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis=
tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe=
nalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =
of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=
s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=
ceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=
 of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=
 of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=
rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=
s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=
ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=
res in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=
n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=
at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=
f Enron Corp. common stock.

There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=
  section 6.3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=
""  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=
ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=
t apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating ""a single sum distrib=
ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one pay=
ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.

The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =
is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=
he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states ""The val=
ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=
g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=
ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock"".=
  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=
 share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =
beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=
p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=
ction 6.3.

The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=
 distribution under each of the three interpretations:




Section 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1

Number of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=
es
Relative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13
Phantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658
10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866
Value to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792
Current stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10
Distribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares

I believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the =
administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7=
.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is =
a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. =
 =20

In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the=
 same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matt=
er.

Sincerely,

This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

WHY THE IDEA OF AN ID CHIP MAKES MY SKIN CRAWL

    Dogs, cats, and cows have them now, so how long
         could it be before a surgically inserted ID
         chip comes to people? In the case of the new
         VeriChip, the answer is how long it takes for
         the FDA to approve it. This is an example of
         a technology that could help some people--but
         hurt lots of others, too. Let me explain why
         the VeriChip should give you shivers, too.

    XP HEATING UP?... DON'T COPY THAT CD!... 'NEW YEAR' WORM
HITS...

    How's Windows XP doing? Not so hot on
    the retail front. But that doesn't mean
    it's going to be a flop. Judging by license
    sales to PC makers and businesses--a
    better measure of an operating system's
    success--XP may become Microsoft's
    best-selling OS yet.

  WANT BETTER WORKPLACE SECURITY? JUST USE SOME COMMON

   Yes, almost every electronic device emits
         radio noise that can be eavesdropped by your
         enemies. But is this really your company's
         biggest security worry? Robert says no. Your
         real concerns are much more mundane--like

WHY THE RIAA OWES US ALL AN APOLOGY

    When recording industry types last week tried
         to get provisions against music swappers
         included in anti-terrorism legislation,
         they trivialized everyone involved in America's
         fight against terrorism--and proved themselves
         to be absolutely the sort of people who'd do
         anything for a buck.

    When you first try out Windows XP, you're

    five--times to sign up for its Passport

  WHY VIEWSONIC'S NEW MONITOR FALLS FLAT--PLUS MORE
  REVIEWS

   New 17-inch flat-panel displays have become
         almost affordable in the past year. But at
         $799, ViewSonic's new model is at the high
         end of the price range--and the features don't
         justify the cost. Josh and John tell you why
         as they bring you this week's new-product

1599,allen-p,"Mac,

 Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:

  Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year
  
  Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf

  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 

   Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:
  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS 
X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share


 That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think 
crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.

 Current price 37
 Nat. Gas 34
 Crude  10

 Total  81

 
 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this 
looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, 
Tosco, and SLB?


Thank you,

 Phillip"
1600,allen-p,"Open the ""utility"" spreadsheet and try to complete the analysis of whether it

You will need to get the usage for that meter for the last 12 months.  If we

Please open this excel file and input the rents and names due for this week.  
Then email the file back."
1602,allen-p,"Lucy,

 The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better.  See if you can add 
these modifications:

 1.  Use a formula in column E.  Add the value in column C to column D.  It 
should read =c6+d6.  Then copy this formula to the rows below.

 2.  Column H needs a formula.  Subtract amount paid from amount owed.  
=e6-g6.

 3.  Column F is filled with the #### sign.  this is because the column width 
is too narrow.  Use you mouse to click on the line beside the 
       letter F.  Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.

 4.  After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to 
this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond.

1603,allen-p,"Brad,

 With regard to Tori Kuykendall, I would like to promote her to commercial 
manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an 
associate.  Her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a 
commercial manager.  I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to 
others in that category at year end.  

 Martin Cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as Tori.  
Hunter would like Martin handled the same as Tori.

 Let me know if there are any issues.

 Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal 
basis and socal/san juan spreads.  I listed the days during bidweek that 
reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints 
before and after bidweek.  



 




 The following observations can be made:

  July 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs 
actual of .79
   2.  Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91
   3.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

  Aug. 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs 
actual of .99
   2.  Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49
   3.  Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the 
monthly postings
   4.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

Hi Phillip.  We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team
Selection information.

Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form
we sent you.  The information needed is then easily transferred into the
database directly from that Excel spreadsheet.  If you do not have the
ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still
require additional information.

We need each person's email address.  Without the email address, we cannot
email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can
we send them an automatic reminder via email.  It would also be good to have
each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.

So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need
to instead, provide the needed information via email.

Thank you for your assistance Phillip.

Subject: Choosing a style


I am planning to build a house in the Texas hillcountry.  The exterior will
be a farmhouse style with porches on front and back.  I am considering the
following features:  stained and scored concrete floors, an open
living/dining/kitchen concept, lots of windows, a home office, 4 bedrooms
all upstairs.  I want a very relaxed and comfortable style, but not exactly
country.  Can you help?

Do not underestimate the effects of the Internet economy on load growth.  I 
have been preaching the tremendous growth described below for the last year.  
The utility infrastructure simply cannot handle these loads at the 
distribution level and ultimatley distributed generation will be required for 
power quality reasons.

The City of Austin, TX has experienced 300+ MW of load growth this year due 
to server farms and technology companies.  There is a 100 MW server farm 
trying to hook up to HL&P as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 months 
due to distribution infrastructure issues.  Obviously, Seattle, Porltand, 
Boise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rude 
awakening in the next 2-3 years.

Internet Data Gain Is a Major Power Drain on
                  Local Utilities 

                  ( September 05, 2000 ) 


                  In 1997, a little-known Silicon Valley company called Exodus
                  Communications opened a 15,000-square-foot data center in 
Tukwila. 

                       The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and 
computer servers for the
                  region's growing number of dot-coms. 

                       Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up 
construction
                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than 
a mile from its
                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several 
fiber optic backbones, the
                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and 
eventually
                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, 
Microsoft and Onvia.com. 

                       Exodus is not the only company building massive data 
centers near Seattle.
                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, 
Globix and
                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house 
the networking
                  equipment of the Internet economy. 

                       It is a big business that could have an effect on 
everything from your
                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access 
your favorite Web sites.

                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and 
server farms, are
                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent 
Valley that some
                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and 
Puget Sound
                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, 
high-security
                  facilities. 

                       ""We are talking to about half a dozen customers that 
are requesting 445
                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,"" 
said Karl
                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound 
Energy. ""That is
                  the equivalent of six oil refineries."" 

                       A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, 
the rise of the Internet
                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their 
heads. 

                       Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington 
Utilities and
                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new 
data centers. The
                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing 
residential and business
                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations 
necessary to support
                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 
million each,
                  Karzmar said. 

                       Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to 
bring up the data center
                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. 

                       For the utilities that provide power to homes, 
businesses and schools in the
                  region, this is a new and complex issue. 

                       On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing 
appetite for power --
                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The 
facilities run 24 hours a
                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a 
constant revenue
                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that 
they could
                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital 
expenditures. 

                       Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will 
mean for power rates
                  in the area is still open to debate. 

                       ""These facilities are what we call extremely dense 
loads,"" said Bob Royer,
                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle 
City Light. 

                       ""The entire University of Washington, from stadium 
lights at the football
                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. 
We have data
                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 
and 50 megawatts."" 

                       With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate 
complex in Tukwila is
                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased 
the 1.35 million
                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from 
Boeing Space &
                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 
92 percent of the
                  six-building complex to seven different co-location 
companies. 

                       ""It is probably the largest data center park in the 
country,"" boasts Laurent
                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG 
Communications,
                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama 
Networks all
                  lease space in the office park. 

                       After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, 
Sabey has become an
                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under 
management or
                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole 
claims his firm is
                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in 
the country. 

                       As more people access the Internet and conduct 
bandwidth-heavy tasks
                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for 
co-location space in
                  Seattle continues to escalate. 

                       But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center 
space is growing at a
                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, 
causing similar
                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and 
California. 

                       Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location 
space, plans to nearly
                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. 
While companies
                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many 
high-tech companies
                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such 
as Exodus that
                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic 
management. 

                       ""We have 2 million square feet of space under 
construction and we plan to
                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more 
demand right now
                  than data center space,"" said Steve Porter, an account 
executive at Exodus in
                  Seattle. 

                       The booming market for co-location space has left some 
in the local utility
                  industry perplexed. 

                       ""It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do 
to serve the growth,""
                  said Seattle City Light's Royer. ""The utility industry is 
almost stunned by this, in
                  a way."""

 Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development 
opportunities.

 I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were 
built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for 
 around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated 
that he had more units under construction that would be 
 available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different 
from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor
 plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.  

 As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.  

 Call or email with your thoughts.

Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls


Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

I was aware that Regan Lehman, the lot developer for the entire 70 lot
duplex project, was selling his units in the $180's,  He does have a much
lower basis in the lots than anyone else, but the prime differences are due
to a) he is selling them during construction and b) they are smaller units.
We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of
the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan.  This would produce an average sq
footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his
sales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell
for $203,108.
What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the
rent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own
evaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the
3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we
were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom
units along with the 3-bedroom plan.
Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.

units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units 
under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with 
competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals 
actually done to date.

1637,allen-p,"George,

 Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate 
project:

 Ownership Structure

 What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner?

 What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what 
capacity(regarding ownership and 
 liabilities)?

 Who owns the land? improvements?

 Who holds the various loans?

 Is the land collateral?

 Investment
 
 What happens to initial investment?

 Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?
 
 Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?

 When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment 
schedule?

 Investment Return

 Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?

 Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits 
are distributed?

 Debt

 Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral 
is associated with each 
 loan?

 Improvement

 Construction

 Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.

 Terms of each loan?

 Uses of Funds

 How will disbursements be made?  By whom?

 What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing 
for investors?

 Reports to track expenses vs plan?

 Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?

 What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get 
paid a markup on subcontractors as a 
 general contractor and paid gain out of profits?

 Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses 
before the ultimate payout of profits?

 Design and Construction
 
 When will design be complete?

 What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?

 What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction 
planning and permitting?

 Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, 
vendors, and other professionals? 
 Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?

 Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to 
use? Names?

These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor 
in a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn as
much as possible from the process.

Phillip"

 The numbers for January are below:

  Actual flows X gas daily spreads          $ 463,000
  Actual flow X Index spreads           $ 543,000
  Jan. value from original bid           $1,750,000
  Estimated cost to unwind hedges         ($1,000,000) 

 Based on these numbers, I suggest we offer to pay at least $500,000 but no 
more than $1,500,000.  I want your input on
 how to negotiate with El Paso.  Do we push actual value, seasonal shape, or 
unwind costs?

Subject: closing



Jeff, 
?
Is the closing today?? After reviewing the  agreement?I find it isn't binding 
as far as I can determine.? It is  too vague and it doesn't sound like 
anything an attorney or title company  would?draft for a real estate 
closing--but, of course, I could be  wrong.? 
?
If this?closing is going to take place without  this agreement then there is 
no point in me  following up on this?document's validity.? 
?
I will just need to go back to my closing documents  and see what's there and 
find out where I am with that and deal with this as  best I can.
?
I guess I was expecting something that would be an  exhibit to a recordable 
document or something a little more exact, or  rather?sort of a contract.? 
This isn't either.? I tried to get a  real estate atty on the phone last 
night but he was out of pocket.? I  talked to a crim. atty friend and he said 
this is out of his area but doesn't  sound binding to him.? 
?
I will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's  transaction?and take a look at 
that but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature? is even 
needed to complete this transaction.?  I am in after 12 noon if there is any 
need to contact me regarding the  closing.
?
I really do not want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myself 
and I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn't 
seem to be something required for a closing.? In  the event you do need my 
signature on something like this I would rather have  time to have it 
reviewed before I accept it.
?

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards
President, Creekside Builders, LLC

lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards

 As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to 
manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  A single buyer entered the 
marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices 
($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.  At the 
time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 
cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to 
report into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of 
line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan.

 We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from 
September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from 
Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage 
firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a 
trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas 
daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread 
relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:

 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater 
than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 

 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & 
Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and 
       October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that 
are dramatically different.


 I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the 
trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to 
determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are 
outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in 
establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at 
$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the 
calculation of index.

 It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to 
conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me 
anytime I can assist you towards this goal.

Westgate

Enclosed are demographics on the Westgate site from Investor's Alliance.
Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package
on San Marcos that you received earlier.
If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know.
Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project?

San Marcos
The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for
sale and approved for 134 units.  The land is selling for $2.50 per square
foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West
San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.

Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes
and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25
per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and
$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This
property will have the best location for student housing of all new
projects, just as the duplexes do now.

If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there
is a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not
yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will
know more on this question later today.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list

Phillip,
 Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, 
on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic 
consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time 
consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the 
inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can 
arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the 
future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 
The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to 
themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this 
project.

I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now 
we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list


From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated 
positions, I think we still have the following issues:
We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had 
three meetings which brought out very different issues from different 
traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader 
requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.
We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to 
be outside the scope of position consolidation.

Things left to do:
I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to 
make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this 
project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.
Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this 
project and which fall out of scope.
For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and 
work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.
Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all 
drill downs.
Use the above to formulate a project plan.

Things requested thus far (no particular order):
Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal 
ticker.
Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that 
add up existing position manager rows/columns).
New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, 
transport, swaps, options, ...
Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values 
of all curves on which the desk has a position.
Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be 
shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid 
would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.
Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the 
appropriate positions to show for each:
Gas Daily for monthly index,
Physical gas for Nymex,
Physical gas for Inside Ferc,
Physical gas for Mid market.
Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of 
using official valuations.
Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.
Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:
Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility 
skew and correlations.
Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  
Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a 
gamma grid.
Valuation of Gas Daily options.
A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.
Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.
Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position 
manager.
Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, 
prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.
Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.
Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of 
individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.
Benchmark positions in TDS.
Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit 
and explicit position break out issues.

-- Allan.

PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for 
transport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that 
point."

 Regarding Patti Sullivan's contributions to the west desk this year, her 
efforts deserve recognition and a PBR award.  Patti stepped up to fill the 
gap left by Randy Gay's personal leave.  Patti held together the scheduling 
group for about 2 month's by working 7days a week during this time.  Patti 
was always the first one in the office during this time.  Frequently, she 
would be at work before 4 AM to prepare the daily operation package.  All the 
traders came to depend on the information Patti provided.   This information 
has been extremely critical this year due to the pipeline explosion and size 
of the west desk positions.  
 Please call to discuss cash award.

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards
President, Creekside Builders, LLC

 Patti Sullivan held together the scheduling group for two months while Randy 
Gay was on a personal leave.  She displayed a tremendous amount of commitment 
to the west desk during that time.  She frequently came to work before 4 AM 
to prepare operations reports.  Patti worked 7 days a week during this time.  
If long hours were not enough, there was a pipeline explosion during this 
time which put extra volatility into the market and extra pressure on Patti.  
She didn't crack and provided much needed info during this time.

 Patti is performing the duties of a manager but being paid as a sr. 
specialist.  Based on her heroic efforts, she deserves a PBR.  Let me know 
what is an acceptable cash amount.

Phillip"
1670,allen-p,"George,

 The San Marcos project is sounding very attractive.  I have one other 
investor in addition to Keith that has interest.  Some additional background 
information on Larry and yourself would be helpful.

 Background Questions:
 
 Please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in 
Creekside.

 Please list projects completed during the last 5 years.  Include the project 
description, investors, business entity, 

 Please provide the names and numbers of prior investors.

 Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on 
recent projects.


 With regard to the proposed investment structure, I would suggest a couple 
of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between Creekside and the 
investors. 


 Preferable Investment Structure:

 Developers guarantee note, not investors.

 Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing.

 Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns.

         Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should 
tackle these issues now.  These questions are not intended to be offensive in 
any way.  It is my desire to build a successful project with Creekside that 
leads to future opportunities.  I  am happy to provide you with any 
information that you need to evaluate myself or Keith as a business partner.

Sincerely,

 The Office of the Chairman agrees to grant origination to the Denver desk as 
follows:

October 2000  $1,395,000
November 2000 $1,350,000
December 2000 $1,395,000
January 2001  $   669,600
February 2001  $   604,800
March 2001  $   669,600
April 2001  $   648,000
May 2001  $   669,600
June 2001  $   648,000
July 2001  $   669,600
August 2001  $   669,600
September 2001 $   648,000
October 2001  $   669,600
November 2001 $   648,000
December 2001 $   669,600

This schedule represents a demand charge payable to NBP Energy Pipelines by 
the Denver desk.  The demand charge is $.18/MMBtu on 250,000 MMBtu/Day 
(Oct-00 thru Dec-00) and 120,000 MMBtu/Day (Jan-01 thru Dec-01).  The ENA 
Office of the Chairman has agreed to reimburse the west desk for this expense.

Enclosed is the cost breakdown for the appraiser.  Note that the
construction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our
standard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio
of 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.

Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs
are high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have
actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf
without overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.

It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairly
sure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.

I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are
$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3
bedroom.  Additional revenues could be generated by building detached
garages, which would rent for $50-75 per month.

13:18 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Cal-ISO Pays $10M To Avoid Rolling Blackouts
Wed -Sources
(This article was originally published Wednesday)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Independent System Operator paid
about $10 million Wednesday for 1,000 megawatts of power from Powerex and
still faced a massive deficit that threatened electricity reliability in the
state, high-ranking market sources familiar with the ISO's operation told
Dow Jones Newswires.
But the ISO fell short of ordering rolling blackouts Wednesday for the third
consecutive day.
The ISO wouldn't comment on the transactions, saying it is sensitive market
information. But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia
Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest
region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid
about $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.
But that still wasn't enough juice.
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts
of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of
$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts
of power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the
$250/MWh price cap.
The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The
municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power
into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP
is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit
claims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville
Power Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the
market at prices 10 times higher.
Powerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying all
transactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000
megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts
- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.
The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state
no matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,
which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having
to compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing
to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.
The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during
a conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency
Wednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared
when the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is
interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.
But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as
a means of attracting additional electricity resources.
""In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,""
Dorinson said.
Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy
unit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &
Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of
the high-priced power.
SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high
wholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by
nearly $1 billion, analysts said. It's still unclear whether retail
customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity
rates or if companies will absorb the costs.

13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South Bay
Pwr Plant
(This article was originally published Wednesday)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California Independent
System Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke Energy
Corp.'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,
Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.
The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state
since Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the
reasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.
About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday,
7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the
ISO.
The ISO manages grid reliability.
As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert
at 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would
dip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid
collapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rolling
blackouts.
The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),
Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE).
Duke's 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representatives
in June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said.

Power Plants
(This article was originally published Wednesday)

   By Jessica Berthold
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--AES Corp. (AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said
Wednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by
some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate
reasons.
The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power
grid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public
Utilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power
plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns,
ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.
The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for
unplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency
for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and
customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be
called on to do so.
As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)
said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday
evening.
Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES
and Dynegy Tuesday evening.
AES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspection
of the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday
morning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron
Thomas said.
Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representatives
returned Wednesday for a full inspection.

   AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits

The Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have
used up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken down
two weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality
Management District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,
Thomas said.
AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire
Huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos
and Redondo Beach plants.
The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES
has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the
company $20 million for polluting.
""We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it,""
Thomas said. ""It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality
district's"" authority.
As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES
could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off
line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.

   Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC

Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday
evening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line
Wednesday.
""I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if you
need to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'"" said Dynegy
spokesman Lynn Lednicky.
Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and
the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could
pose a safety hazard if not repaired.
""We've been doing all we can to get back in service,"" Lednicky said. ""We
even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.""
Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation of
why its units were off line.

Christy,

 I read these points and they definitely need some touch up.  I don't 
understand why we need to give our commentary on  why prices are so high in 
California.  This subject has already gotten so much press.

First one's free. So are the next thousand.

You know it's true: Video games are addictive. Sure, we could
trap you with a free game of Centipede, then kick up the price
after you're hooked. But that's not how shockwave.com operates.
Shockmachine -- the greatest thing since needle exchange -- is
now free; so are the classic arcade games. Who needs quarters?
Get Arcade Classics from shockwave.com, stick 'em in your
Shockmachine and then play them offline anytime you want.

You've got a date with Frogger. This frog won't turn into a handsome
prince(ss), but it's sure to bring back great memories of hopping
through the arcade -- and this time, you can save your quarters for
laundry. Which might increase your potential for a date on Saturday.

Subject: REVISION - - LOAD AND RESOURCE ESTIMATES


Most control areas have now reported the amount of load relief and generation 
increase that was experienced over the Peak period (17:00-18:00 PST) on 
December 12.  The data I have received thus far are summarized in the 
following paragraphs.

The approximate amount of load relief achieved due to conservation or 
curtailments over the Peak period on December 12 was 835 MWh.

The approximate amount of generation increase due to extraordinary operations 
or purchases over the Peak period on December 12 was 786 MWh.

A note of caution, these figures are very imprecise and were derived with a 
lot of guesswork.  However, they should be within the ballpark of reality.

--  WHAT'S NEW ON Y-LIFE  --
Jon Katz's Internet Domain
Will the Net change everything? Might we be overrun by new gadgets
and new technology? Will our lives be ruled by the almighty dot-
com? Will the Net fail? Don't believe the hype: Katz has a simple
guide to surviving the panic.

--  NET RADIO SITE OF THE DAY  --
Today: Lost in the cosmos of Net-radio stations? Sorry, this site
will probably only add to the confusion. FMcities houses over 1,350
stations in North America, organized by city. Sound daunting? It
is... but here's the good part - every site listed here is 100-
percent commercial-free. That's right, nothing but the good stuff.
Sorry, Pepsi. Sorry, McDonald's. Sorry, RJ Reynolds...
http://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?70393:8593142

--  INCREDIBLY USEFUL SITE OF THE DAY  --
Today: ""Always buy a Swiss watch, an American motorcycle, and a
Japanese radio."" If that's the kind of buying advice the folks at
the water cooler are giving you, it's time to look elsewhere - like
ConsumerSearch. Whether what you want is as complicated as a car or
computer or as simple as a kitchen knife, you'll find links to
reviews here, distilled so that you can quickly scan for the best
items in each category.

--  PRETTY STRANGE SITE OF THE DAY  --
Today: Are you a loser? Do you have lots of time on your hands
because no one would socialize with you if your life depended on
it? Do you have incredible powers of concentration for even the
most mundane and boring tasks? Congratulations! You might be the
person with the strength, stamina, and general dorkiness to win the
World Mouseclicking Competition.

to check those bookmarks individually, says the Guru. You can check

a math teacher would put on that statement? A gardener? A musician?

1726,allen-p,"Folks,

I just found this interesting site about the history of the uses of lime and
development of pozzolonic materials ...lime and clay - Roman Cement -  that I
think will be interesting to the group.

I highly recommend David Moore's book ""The Roman Pantheon"" at $25.00  -   a
very thorough research into the uses and development of Roman Cement....lime
and clay/pozzolonic ash; the making and uses of lime in building. The book
covers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete.

I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily -
interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 years
learning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings,
structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash -  structures that have
lasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good
background information for sustainable builder folks.

Thank you, Mr. Moore. I highly recommend the site and especially the Book.

Western Power Prices Fall With Warmer Weather, Natural Gas Loss

     Los Angeles, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Western spot
power prices declined today from a combination of warmer weather
across the region and declining natural gas prices.
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average about 2 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal for the next seven days. In the Southwest
temperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal.
     At the California-Oregon Border, heavy load power fell
$172.00 from yesterday to $430.00-$475.00.
     ""What happened to all of this bitter cold weather we were
supposed to have,'' said one Northwest power marketer. Since the
weather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower.""
     Temperatures in Los Angeles today will peak at 66 degrees,
and are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend.
     Natural gas to be delivered to the California Oregon from the
El Paso Pipeline traded between $20-$21, down $3 from yesterday.
     ""Gas prices are declining causing western daily power prices
to fall,'' said one Northwest power trader.
     At the NP-15 delivery point heavy load power decreased
$206.25 from yesterday to $325.00-$450.00. Light load energy fell
to $200.00-$350.00, falling $175.00 from yesterday.
     PSC of New Mexico's 498-megawatt San Juan Unit 4 coal plant
was shut down this morning for a tube leak. The unit is scheduled
to restart this weekend.
     At the Four Corners located in New Mexico, power traded at
$325.00-$335.00 plunging $182.50 from yesterday.

PJM Spot Power Prices Dip With Weather, Falling Natural Gas

     Philadelphia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak next-day
power prices declined at the western hub of the Pennsylvania-New
Jersey-Maryland Interconnection amid warmer weather forecasts and
falling natural gas prices, traders said.
     The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power at western
PJM declined an average of $12.75 a megawatt-hour, with trades
ranging from $62.00-$76.00.
     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.
forecast tomorrow's high temperature in Philadelphia at 40 degrees
Fahrenheit, up 7 degrees from today's expected high. Temperatures
could climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday.
     ""Most of the day's activity took place in the early part of
the morning,"" said one PJM-based trader. ""By options expiration
the market had pretty much dried up.""
     Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the main
reason for the decline in spot market prices.
     Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to the
New York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per million
British thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. Since
Monday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of
$2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecasts
indicated reduced utility load requirements.
     In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies they
normally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weather
forecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets.
     Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13
higher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the
$67.00-$75.00 range. Power at Zone J sold $7.50 higher at $90.00-
$92.00.

Mid-Continent Power Prices Drop on Revised Forecast, Gas Prices

     Cincinnati, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continent
next-day peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revised
warmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said.
     The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power on the
Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system dropped $23.19
to $67.90 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $75.00 as the
market opened down to $59.00 after options expired.
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power on
the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison Co. grid sold $21.37 lower
on average at $60.00-$75.00, while power in lower MAIN sold $18.17
lower at $65.00-$100.00.
     Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc. predicted
high temperatures would average 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal
in Chicago and at normal levels in Cincinnati over the next seven
days, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal Monday, respectively.
     Traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulled
prices down. Natural gas prices were a large factor in recent
electricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-fired
generation to meet increased weather-related demand.
     Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an average
of 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million British
thermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an average
of 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu.
     ""The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've got
people coming to their senses,"" one trader said. ""These are much
more realistic prices.""
     Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if the
outlook for weather continues to be mild. Peak Cinergy power for
delivery from Dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00
yesterday.
     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices plunged
with warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmission
capacity, selling $37.67 less in northern MAPP and $44.17 less in
southern MAPP at $75.00-$125.00.
     ""What's happening is the people who don't have firm
transmission are getting into the market early and buying at those
high prices since they have no choice,"" one MAPP trader said.
     ""Then you've got some people who were lucky enough to get a
firm path who waited until later in the morning when ComEd prices
fell off,"" he said, ""and bought from them at those lower prices,
causing the huge gap between the day's high and low trade.""

Southeast U.S. Electricity Prices Slump After Mild Forecast

     Atlanta, Georgia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Southeast
U.S. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather was
forecast for the region this week, traders said.
     Traders said Southeast utility demand has been reduced since
many large population centers like Atlanta will see temperatures
climb into the mid-50s Fahrenheit later this week.
     ""There was nothing going on in Florida today,"" said one
southern energy trader. ""Everything was going to markets in the
north.""
     Traders said supply was being routed from Florida into
markets on the Entergy Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority
grid in the mid-$70s a megawatt-hour.
     ""Prices into TVA started in the $80s and $90s and crumbled as
forecasts came out,"" said on Entergy power trader. ""Prices,
declined to $60 and less.""
     The Bloomberg into TVA index price fell an average of $23.95
to $70.25 amid trades in the $65.00-$80.00 range. Off-peak trades
were noted at $32.00, several dollars higher than recent
estimates.
     Southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weather
forecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week
caused prices to decline in the region.
     In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather was
the main culprit behind lower prices.
     ""The cold weather's backing off,"" said one SPP utility
trader. ""It was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday and
today it's about 9 degrees with the wind chill.  Yesterday, it was
bitter cold and today it was just plain cold.""
     Power sold in northern sections of SPP at $78-$100, though
the Bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to $88.00. Southern
SPP traded at $82.00, $2 more than yesterday.

U.K. Day-Ahead Electricity Prices Rise Amid Increased Demand

     London, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity prices in
the U.K. rose today after falling temperatures were expected to
increase household consumption for space heating, traders said.
     The day-ahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by the
Electricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01
pounds a megawatt-hour.
     Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degrees
to 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather Services
Corp. in the U.S.
     Day-ahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15
pounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday.
     December continued to fall amid a combination of position
closing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will
not rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said.
     December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds a
megawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday's last trade.
     First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with
expectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue
to stifle demand, traders said.
     January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds a
megawatt-hour, falling 17 pence.
     First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds a
megawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close.
     Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer
2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour.
Winter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a
megawatt-hour.
     Open positions on many short-term structures will likely
force many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run-
up to Christmas, traders said. Adding that other structures will
probably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more
easily be assessed.

Nordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast

     Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices
on the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher today
as colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said.
     Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt-
hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday's closing trade on 1,076
megawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446
megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede after
forecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia for
next week. These producers typically generate power to prevent
reservoirs from overflowing.
     Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise
with falling temperatures because of increased requirements for
space heating.
     Traded volume on the power exchange increased in active
trading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders
said.
     ""The market's been waiting for this day for a long time,"" a
Stockholm-based trader said. ""For too long, people have been
selling because winter hasn't lived up to expectations. We should
now see a noticeable increase in the spot price.""
     Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fall
below freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limited
chances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to Weather
Services Corp. in the U.S.
     The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand was
expected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict
temperatures to begin falling.
     Thursday's system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22
percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell
4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts.
     Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise
by 10-15 kroner by the start of next week.
     Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter-
term contracts.
     Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour,
1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner a
megawatt-hour.
     Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, although
expected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producers
to meet the increased demand, other traders said.
     Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor,
will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said.
     Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used
today's news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said.

Why am I not surprised ?

I suspect that if someone were to build a town called Lime, make
everything in the town out of lime, provide only foods that have
some connection to lime and then bury the Limeys in lime when
they're dead, 'Arry would move to that town in a flash and think

Phillip"
1761,allen-p,"Steve,


I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.  If 
you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.









As far as recommendations, here is a short list:

 1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales 
above monthly index without enough consideration of future 
      replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be 
injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.
                    This creates a shortage in later months.

 2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet 
demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.  
                      Specific questions should include:  

  1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order 
to fill storage?

  2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too 
much gas from Socal's system.  
       I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their 
own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than 
their injection capablity, but injected far less.

 3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short 
term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major 
                    LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating 
rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market 
and the 
     consumer has benefitted.  


Call me if you need any more input.


Phillip"
1762,allen-p,"Jeff,

Everything should be done for closing on the Leander deal on the 29th.  I 
have fed ex'd the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out 
tomorrow.    When will more money be required?  Escrow for roads?  Utility 
connections?  Other rezoning costs?  

What about property taxes?  The burnet land lost its ag exemption while I 
owned it.  Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this 
property?  Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes 
once the property is rezoned?  Do we need to find a farmer and give him 
grazing rights?

What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and 
annexing?  I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and 
American Multifamily walking on this deal.  So I just want to make sure we 
are pushing the process as fast as we can.

 I would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project I 
described to you last week.  The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in 
San Marcos.  There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a 
couple of other investors involved.  As I mentioned last week, I would like 
to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not 
require the investors to personally guarantee.  If there is a creative way to 
structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.  One idea that has 
been mentioned is to obtain a ""forward commitment"" in order to reduce the 
equity required.  I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this 
nature are normally financed.  Specifically, the transition from interim to 
permanent financing.  I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be 
important to banks. 

 I am faxing you a project summary.  And I will have the builder/developer 
email or fax his financial statement to you.

 I know Larry has been working with a bank and they need my information.  I 
hope to pull that together this afternoon.

 I took the liberty of calling Thomas Reames from the Frog Pond document.  He 
was positive about his experience overall.  He did not seem pleased with the

Subject: Meeting with Governor Davis, need for additional comments/suggestions

We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA.  In attendance were Ken Lay, 
the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. 
spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his 
ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next 
week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.  
Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on 
my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff 
Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our 
proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation 
based on the governor's comments:

Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that 
we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing 
communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to 
go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what 
the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more 
work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He 
talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail 
level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the 
benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he 
would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power 
(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented 
solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix 
the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.
Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also 
included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed 
interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a 
goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities 
to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate 
analysts and other ""nonadvocates"" to develop solutions to a number of issues 
including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  
He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas 
purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding 
some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.
His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously 
under serious consideration and some of which were mere ""brainstorming"".  
Some of these ideas would require legislative action.
State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a ""couple"" of 
generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that 
they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This 
was a frequently recurring theme.
Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus 
basis to consumers.
Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in 
California.
State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more 
widely deploy distributed generation.
Expand in-state gas production.
Take state lands gas royalties in kind.
negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for 
addtional gas supplies.
Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant 
maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at 
any one time.
Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.
Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear 
more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be 
able to help out here).
Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made 
some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy 
some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation 
thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control 
approach with generators.
Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.
To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's 
thoughts and get them to Kari)
He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- 
not just the 5 one year strips.
He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.
He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the 
deal.
He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the 
forward contracting issues.
Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today."

1770,allen-p,"Questions about 12/29 rentroll:

 There were two deposits that were not labeled.  One for $150 and the other 
for $75.  Which apartments?  20a or #13?

 Utility overages for #26 and #44?  Where did you get these amounts?  For 
what periods?

 
What is going on with #42.   Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!!  
That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money 
and time remodeling.  I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first 
asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like 
leaky pipes.  If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the 
apartment and charge them for the labor.  Then we will perform monthly 
inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property.  This tenant has 
been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off.

I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so 
I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank.  Is this 
right?  Has the deposit been made yet?

Here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages.  There

You need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap.  
This needs to be handwritten on all new leases.

I am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet.  We 
also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need 
to conserve energy if they don't want to exceed their cap.  I will write 
something today.



Wait until you have copies of the bills and the letter before you start

Subject: California Action Update 1-14-00

Enron has agreed that the key issue is to focus on solving the S-T buying 
needs.  Attached is a spreadsheet that outlines the $ magnitude of the next 
few months.

TALKING POINTS:

Lot's of questions about DWR becoming the  vehicle for S-T buying and there 
is a significant legal risk for it becoming the vehicle.  WE DO NEED 
SOMETHING TO BRIDGE BEFORE WE PUT IN L-T CONTRACTS.
Huge and growing shortfall ($3.2B through March 31, 2001) 
The SOONER YOU CAN PUT IN L-T CONTRACTS STOP THE BLEEDING.
Bankruptcy takes all authority out of the Legislature's hands.

ACTION ITEMS:

1. Energy Sales Participation Agreement During Bankruptcy

Michael Tribolet will be contacting John Klauberg to discuss how to organize 
a Participation Agreement to sell to UDCs in Bankruptcy while securing Super 
Priority.

2. Legislative Language for CDWR (?) Buying Short-Term

Sandi McCubbin / Jeff Dasovich will lead team to offer new language to meet 
S-T requirements of UDCs.  Key is to talk with State of California Treasurer 
to see if the $ can be found or provided to private firms.  ($3.5B by end of 
April).  Pat Boylston will develop ""public benefit"" language for options 
working with Mike Day.  He can be reached at 503-294-9116 or 
pgboylston@stoel.com.

3. Get Team to Sacramento

Get with Hertzberg to discuss the options (Bev Hansen).  Explain the 
magnitude of the problem.  Get Mike Day to help draft language.  

4. See if UDCs have any Thoughts

Steve Kean will communicate with UDCs to see if they have any solutions or 
thougths.  Probably of limited value.

5. Update List

Any new information on this should be communicated to the following people as 
soon as possible.  These people should update their respective business units.

As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile 
Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas 
storage number. 

The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the 
forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a 
supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. 

""Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,"" said William Burson, 
a trader. ""It makes the market for natural gas."" 

But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas 
Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the 
storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the 
numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than 
reality. 

""It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what 
we are reporting,"" McGill said. 

As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- 
and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing 
fingers at Wall Street. 

Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently 
stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for 
the rise in gas prices. 

""It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,"" Adik 
told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. 

In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric 
utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. 

Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame 
for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their 
customers and constituents from such price spikes. 

Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take 
precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price 
insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas 
prices before they soared. 

""We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said Paul 
Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. 

But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. 

""There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to 
change,"" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security 
Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. 


Hot topic 

Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In 
many circles, little else is discussed. 

The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is 
facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the 
previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as 
well. 

The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of 
his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial 
pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. 

""It's the talk of the town here,"" he said. 

A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per 
thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile 
to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by 
customers. 

But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand 
cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage 
for winter. 

There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, 
prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information 
Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating 
bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. 

But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, 
including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas 
markets. 

""It's all about the weather,"" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. 

Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York 
traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile 
commodity in the world. 


Setting the price 

In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of 
gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading 
contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had 
widespread influence over gas prices. 

The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon 
as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale 
prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from 
utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what 
they pay for the gas they expect to use. 

There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention 
of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge 
of natural gas. 

But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to 
know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all 
futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to 
their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money 
in a short time. 

As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less 
than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. 
Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's 
weekly storage numbers. 

Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to 
need in the winter. 

Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than 
average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in 
hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. 

Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be 
sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the 
concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. 

Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage 
numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the 
association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. 

But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice 
president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had 
continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. 

""I was getting worried,"" he said. 

Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. 
Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices 
dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. 


Just passing through 

Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but 
pass their fuel costs on to customers. 

Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas 
charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas 
Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. 

Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last 
month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could 
be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve 
energy. 

Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to 
save an average customer about $25 this winter. 

Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an 
extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not 
guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. 

Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left 
customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether 
they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel 
costs. 

On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public 
Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to 
perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. 

""Consumers are taking all the risk,"" Micheel said. ""It's time to consider 
some changes.""

#32 and #29 are fine.  

#28 paid weekly on 1/5.  Then he switched to biweekly.  He should have paid 
260 on 1/12.  Two weeks rent in advance.  Instead he paid 260 on 1/19.  He 
either needs to get back on schedule or let him know he is paying in the 
middle of his two weeks.  He is only paid one week in advance.  This is not a

All,

The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that 
need to be addressed immediately.  While we anticipate many new Analysts 
joining Enron this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it 
necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting 
event.  We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting 
approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed.  I am asking that you forward 
this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above).  We will conduct 
first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the 
afternoon.  We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning 
(9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session.  Please submit your 
response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date.  In 
addition, we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking 
one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer.   Thanks in 
advance for your cooperation.

Phillip:

It looks like a deal with the non gas fired QFs is iminent.  One for the gas 
generators is still quite a ways off.  

The non gas fired QFs will be getting a fixed price for 5 years and reverting 
back to their contracts thereafter.  They also will give back 

I would expect that the gas deal using an implied gas price times a heat rate 
would be very very difficult to close.  Don't expect hedgers to come any time 
soon.

I will keep you abreast of developments.

Subject: Status of QF negotiations on QFs & Legislative Update

This from a conference call with IEP tonight at 5 pm:

RE;  Non-Gas-fired QFs -- The last e-mail I sent includes the latest version 
of the IEP proposal.  Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially 
complete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed with 
the IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would ""retain"" $106 million (of 
what, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who 
switched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the 
QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December 
(and maybe earlier).

PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the 
Force Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get 
some assurances of payment. 

SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due 
on 2/2/01.

For gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E's 
purchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements 
(Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be 
resolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.  No discussions on this 
occurred today.

Status of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will 
happen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.  
Plan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg's new bill .  Hydro as security is 
dead. Republicans were very much opposed to it."

George,

Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders 
profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be 
recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would 
be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.



Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the 
investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned 
earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as 
part of the construction contract.  

Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look 
like here are a few ideas:

 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from 
higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.

 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 
1 complete in November)
      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule
      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule

This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but 
could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule 
must be discussed and agreed upon.

=09=09 Subject: CPUC Audit Report on Edison

The following are the highlights from the Executive Summary of the KPMG aud=
it=20
report on Southern California Edison:
=20
I. Cash Needs
Highlights:
SCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=
plete=20
cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20
program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=
s=20
and other measures.=20
Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20
available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=
.8=20
million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20
conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.
II. Credit Relationships
Highlights:
SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20
extend or renew credit as it has become due.
At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.
SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=
lt.=20
Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=
nd=20
payable.
SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond=
=20
indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20
indebtedness if it were feasible to do so.
Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =
its=20
rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade=
=20
issues within the last three weeks.
III. Energy Cost Scenarios
Highlights
This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20
various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=
 such=20
scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.
IV. Cost Containment Initiatives
Highlights
SCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.
The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital=
=20
improvement component as follows (in millions):
Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77
Capital Improvement Costs                383
Total                                             $ 460
The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to=
=20
be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=
om=20
contract employees.
Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the=
=20
most part being deferred to a future date.
SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20
executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20
savings of approximately $92 million.
V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20
Activity)
Highlights:
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20
Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20
includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20
million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s=
=20
Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.
Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=
e=20
end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit=
=20
balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20
D.01-01-018.
Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20
generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20
tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20
expressed in the TRA, are overstated.
TURN Proposal
As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=
RN=20
to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=
s.=20
Our comments are summarized as follows:
The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=
t=20
would not directly generate nor use cash.
The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=
ift=20
costs between two regulatory assets.
TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=
 the=20
revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =
in=20
the TRA is overstated.
VI. Flow of Funds Analysis
Highlights:
In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a=
=20
positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.
During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to=
=20
its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.
Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its=
=20
shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=
on=20
stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=
ve=20
and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.
[there is no Section VII]
=20
VIII. Earnings of California Affiliates
SCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500=
=20
million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20
In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.=
=20
This increase correlates to the increase in market prices
for natural gas for the same period.

1804,allen-p,"George,

The probability of building a house this year is increasing.  I have shifted 
to a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I could 
not work out in the plan we discussed previously.  Now, I am leaning more 
towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  One 
wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 
kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage + 
guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  This 
plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the 
courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor 
living.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. 
 The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass 
skylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to have 
single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.  

I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.  I would 
like to come and visit you again this month.  If it would work for you, I 
would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.  I 
would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we 
didn't have time for.  I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan. 

Call or email to let me know if this would work for you.

PS.  Channel 2 in Houston ran a story yesterday (Feb. 2) about a home in

Please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the ""Rent Due"" column.  The 
other questions I had about last week's rent are:

#15  Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26.  What is 
going on?

#25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit

#27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.  Why?

I spoke to Jeff Smith.  I think he was surprised that we were set up with 
email and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff know 
that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the 
property.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show 
them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.  

Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right 
now.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet 
but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wade 
continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the 
property's tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better and 
better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.  

Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  It 
is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move 
in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  I 
realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and 
your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be 
working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running 
an errand for the property.

I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this 
time.  We can look at again later in the year.

I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.

When we meet,  I would like to address the following issues:

1.)  I had at least 5 people here past midnight on both nights and I have 
several people who have not left before 10:30 this week. 
2.)  It is my understanding that Susan was still booking new day deals on 
Thursday night at 8:30 b/c she did not get deal tickets from the trading 
floor until after 5:00 p.m.
3.)  It is also my understanding that Susan is done with the p&l and 
benchmark part of her book often times by 6:00,  but that what keeps her here 
late is usually running numerous extra models and spreadsheets.  (One 
suggestion might be a permanent IT person on this book.)  (This was also my 
understanding from Kyle Etter,  who has left the company.)

I would like to get this resolved as soon as possible so that Larry can get 
the information that he needs to be effective and so that we can run books 
like this and not lose good people.

Thanks

1812,allen-p,"Jeff,

I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 
years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%.  There are several 
reasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, the 
large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer 
are the three biggest concerns.  

What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the 
buyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come due 
until September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold the 
property.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to make 
the deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinance 
is pushing too far.

Can you clarify the dates in the contract.  Is the effective date the day the 
earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?

Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.  I got your fax from the New 
Braunfels buyer.  If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get 
started on the list.

Email or call  me later today.

Phillip"
1813,allen-p,"Jeff,

My target is to get $225 back out of the stage.  Therefore, I could take a 
sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K.  This would still only 
require $75K cash from the buyer.  After broker fees and a title policy, I 
would net around $20K cash.  

You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or 
higher with the terms described in the 1st email.  Do you want to give the 
New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal.

Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract?  

The key business points are:

1.  Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate

2.  Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million

3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.

4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?

5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.

With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a 
solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes 
costs.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and I 
would like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to fax 
all invoices within 48 hours.  We also would want online access to the 
checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing 
but invoices were not being submitted.

Let me know if you can draft these agreements.  The GP issue may need some 
tweaking.

Here is the rentroll for this Friday.  Sorry it is so late.



There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2.

1.  I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank 
is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865.   The missing money on the 
spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.

2.  #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?

3.  #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?

4.  #11 Missed on 2/2?

5.  #13 Missed on 1/26?

6.  #14  missed on 2/2?

7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?

8.  #20a missed on 2/2?

9.  #35 missed on 2/2?

My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.  
You may have sent me a message over the ""chat"" line that I don't remember on 
some of these.  I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the 
bank deposit.

Will have some time today to work on a utility letter.  Tried to call Wade 
last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him.  Will try again today.

I believe that a doctor from Seguin is going to make an offer.  Did you meet 
them?  If so, what did you think?

Here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject 
to caps.  I wrote it as if it were from you.  It should come from the manager.

It is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there 
unit is when they move in.  This needs to be written in on their lease.

When you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize 
that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up.  

Have my Dad read the memo before you put it out.   You guys can make changes 
if you need to.





Next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and 
refrigerators.  We have to get this done next week.  I will email you a form 
to use to record serial numbers.  The prospective buyers want this 
information plus we need it for our records.  Something to look forward to.

This should probably be researched further.  If they can really build this 
many plants it could have a huge impact on the Cal border basis.  Obviously 
it is dependent on what capacity is added on Kern, PGT and TW but it is hard 
to envision enough subscriptions to meet this demand.  Even if it is 
subscribed it will take 18 months to 2 years to build new pipe therefore the 
El Paso 1.2 Bcf/d could be even more valuable.

Phillip these are the volumes that AEC is considering selling at Opal over 
the next five years.  The structure they are looking for is a firm physical 
sale at a NYMEX related price.  There is a very good chance that they will do 
this all with one party.  We are definitely being considered as that party.  
Given what we have seen in the marketplace they may be one of the few 
producers willing to sell long dated physical gas for size into Kern River.

What would be your bid for this gas?

Subject: CERA Analysis - California

As discussed in the California conference call this morning, I have prepared 
a bullet-point summary of the CERA Special Report titled Beyond the 
California Power Crisis: Impact, Solutions, and Lessons.If you have any 
questions, my phone number is 713 853-3170.

Here is the 2/2 rentroll.  The total does not equal the bank deposit.  Your 
earlier response answered the questions for #3,11,15,20a, and 35.

But the deposit was $495 more than the rentroll adds up to.  If the answer to 
this question lies in apartment 1,13, and 14, can you update this file and 
send it back.

Now I am going to work on a rentroll for this Friday.  I will probably send 
you some questions about the 2/9 rentroll.  Let's get this stuff clean today.

Thanks for clearing up the 2/2 file.  Moving on to 2/9, here are some 
questions:




#1 It looks like he just missed 1/26&2/9 of $110.  I can't tell if he still 
owes $47 on his deposit.

#13 I show she missed rent on 1/26 and still owes $140.

#15 Try and follow up with Tomas about the $95.  Hopefully, he won't have a 
bad reaction.

#20b Missed rent?

#26  Has she paid any deposit or rent?

#27 Missed rent?"
1829,allen-p,"Mac,

I checked into executing my options with Smith Barney.  Bad news.  Enron has 
an agreement with Paine Webber that is exclusive.  Employees don't have the 
choice of where to exercise.  I still would like to get to the premier 
service account, but I will have to transfer the money.  

Hopefully this will reach you.

Phillip"
1830,allen-p,"Forward Reg Dickson's resume to Ted Bland for consideration for the trading 
track program.  He is overqualified and I'm sure too expensive to fill the 
scheduling position I have available.  I will work with Cournie Parker to 
evaluate the other resumes.

Phillip"
1831,allen-p,"Jeff,

Here is the application from SPB.  I guess they want to use the same form as 
a new loan application.  I have a call in to Lee O'Donnell to try to find out 
if there is a shorter form.  What do I need to be providing to the buyer 
according to the contract.  I was planning on bringing a copy of the survey 
and a rentroll including deposits on Monday.  Please let me know this morning 
what else I should be putting together.

Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies 
forecasts?  I will set up a room with Kim.

Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen:

1.  Review and document systems and processes  -   The handoffs from ERMS, 
TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the 
       parties trying to make improvements.  I think I understand ERMS and 
TAGG but the issues facing 
       scheduling in Unify are grey.

2.  Review and audit complex deals- Under the ""assume it is messed up"" 
policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need 
further      scrutiny.

3.  Review risk books-  Is Enron accurately accounting for physical 
imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?

4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design training 
courses, review progress and make cuts.

5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.  Are we looking at 
everything we should?  Putting a person with a trading mentality should add 
   some value and direction to the group.


In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD 
to work part time to get it done.

There have been some updates to the cost.  The principal change is in the
addition of masonry on the front of the buildings, which I estimate will
costs at least $84,000 additional.  Also, the trim material and labor costs
have been increased.  I still believe that the total cost is more than
sufficient, but there will be additional updates.

The manager's unit is columns J-L, but the total is not included in the B&N
total of rentable units.  Rather, the total cost for the manager's unit and
office is included as a lump sum under amenities.  I may add this back in as
a rentable unit and delete is as an amenity.

The financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanent
mortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for the
construction loan approval, therefore, its cost will be absorbed when this
loan is obtained.

Based on either a loan equal to 75% of value or 80% of cost, the
construction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land.

Phillip,

I spoke with AMF's broker today, and they will be satisfied with the deal if
we can get the school to agree to limit the current land use restrictions to
the terms that are in the existing agreement.  They do not want the school
to come back at a later date for something different.  Doug Bell will meet
with a school official on Monday to see what their thoughts are about the
subject.  It would be hard for them to change the current agreement, but AMF
wants something in writing to that effect.  I spoke to AMF's attorney today,
and explained the situation.  They are OK with deal if AMF is satisfied.

AMF's broker said that they will be ready to submit their site plan after
the March 29 hearing.  We may close this deal in April.

The Stage is still on go.  An assumption package has been sent to the buyer,
and I have overnighted a copy of the contract and a description of the
details to Wayne McCoy.

I will be gone Thurs. and Fri. of this week.  I will be checking my
messages.

Phillip -

George Richards asked that I drop you a line this morning to go over some
details on the San Marcos project.

1.  First, do you know if I am to receive a personal financial statement from
Keith?  I want to make sure my credit write-up includes all the principals in
the transaction.

2.  Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC) 
will
be in the range of 75% - 80%.  The proposed Loan to Value of 75% is within the
acceptable range for a typical Multi-Family deal.  Given the above pro-forma
performance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my credit
officer as an 80% LTC.  This, of course, is subject to the credit officer
signing off on the deal.

3.  The Bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the Developers
deferred profit.  Typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget as
deferred profit has been acceptable.

Thanks,

Here are few questions regarding the 2/16 rentroll:

#2  Has she actually paid the $150 deposit.  Her move in date was 2/6.  It is 
not on any rentroll that I can see.

#9  Explain again what deposit and rent is transferring from #41 and when she 
will start paying on #9

#15  Since he has been such a good tenant for so long.  Stop trying to 
collect the $95 in question.

#33  Missed rent.  Are they still there?

#26  I see that she paid a deposit.  But the file says she moved in on 1/30.  
Has she ever paid rent?  I can't find any on the last three deposits.

#44  Have the paid for February?  There is no payment since the beginning of 
the year.

#33  You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't 
see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit?

The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent.  I need you to 
figure these out immediately.

I emailed you a new file for 2/23 and have attached the last three rentroll 
in case you need to research these questions.

I will not be in the office next week.  If I can get connected you might be 
able to email me at pallen70@hotmail.com.  Otherwise try and work with Gary 
on pressing issues.  If there is an emergency you can call me at 713-410-4679.

I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still have the 
concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our project 
are too high.  I have gathered more information that support my concerns.  
Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5 
million.  The components are as follows:

 Unit Cost, Site work, &
 builders profit($52/sf)   $7.6 million

 Land      1.15

 Interim Financing     .85

 Common Areas       .80

 Total     $10.4

Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to 
get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.  

Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A 
properties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce 
the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for location and the 
seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize that Sagewood is 
currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer to 
the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market 
will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.  Supply will inevitablely 
increase to drive this market more in balance.

After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost 
estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  He 
feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million.  
We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.

Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we 
cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million.   
We would like to have a conference call tomorrow to discuss alternatives.

Subject:  Sagewood Phase II


George,

Thank you for the opportunity to review your financing request for the 
Sagewood
Phase II project.  Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the
project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are a
number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward
on the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a
Bedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjusted
pro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are
acheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about 
500+
units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, 
this,
we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious
effect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requested
loan amount to $8,868,000.

I have summarized our issues as follows:

1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:

     Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment
     Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR
     2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475
     3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417

2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit
turn over.

3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).

4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support
debt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x 
debt
coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.

5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.

6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide
equity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:

     Land -                   $1,121,670
     Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000
     Cash Equity              $1,419,268
     Total                    $2,955,938

7. Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage 
of
actual hard construction costs.

Let's have Matt start on the following:

Database for hourly storage activity on Socal.  Begin forecasting hourly and 
daily activity by backing out receipts, using ISO load actuals and backing 
out real time imports to get in state gen numbers for gas consumption, and 
then using temps to estimate core gas load.  Back testing once he gets 
database created should help him forecast core demand.

Update Socal and PG&E forecast sheets.  Also, break out new gen by EPNG and 
TW pipelines.

George finally sent me some information.  Please look over his email.  He 
wants us to buy him out.  Keith and I think this is a joke.  

We still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to 
determine if it has any value going forward.  I don't believe the architect 
work will be of any use to us.  I don't think they deserve any compensation 
for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were 
proposing was unsupportable by the market.  

My version of a buyout is attached.

I need your expert advise.  I am ready to offer my version or threaten to 
foreclose.  Do they have a case that they are due money for their time?  
Since their cost
and fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I 
wouldn't think they would stand a chance.  There isn't any time to waste so I 
want to respond to their offer asap.

Call me with your thoughts.

Subject: Bishops Corner, Ltd. -- Restructure or Buyout

Dear Phillip and Keith: 

We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash 
expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of 
all note obligations and design contracts.? 

As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and 
existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, 
and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which 
current unpaid invoices due total $37,325.

Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this 
project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design 
and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of 
our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or 
rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? 

Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a 
percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on 
your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, 
or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the 
second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per 
year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these 
valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the 
forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in 
the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future 
projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per 
month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the 
attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings 
the total net buyout to $78,946.? 

We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we 
offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout 
offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are 
prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? 
If this is your 



choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, 
Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then 
draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the 
Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout 
amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts.

Thank you.

1867,allen-p,"Here is the buyout spreadsheet again with a slight tweak in the format.  The 
summary  presents the numbers as only $1400 in concessions."
1868,allen-p,"Gentlemen,

Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to 
date.  I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property is 
still in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot 
and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a 
topographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to 
coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the 
smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going 
to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to 
complete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which 
$14,000 are due now for work completed.  

We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by 
the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can 
continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's 
number is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and 
ask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call 
and he was fine with that.  

Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp 
Flores can be used.

Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left very 
optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.

Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about 
moving this project forward.

rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? 

Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a 
percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on 
your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, 
or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the 
second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per 
year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these 
valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the 
forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in 
the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future 
projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per 
month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the 
attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings 
the total net buyout to $78,946.? 

We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we 
offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout 
offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are 
prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? 
If this is your 



choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, 
Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then 
draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the 
Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout 
amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts.

Thank you.

FYI Western Price Survey Contacts

Cal-ISO's declaration of Stage Two alert this morning was triggered
in part by decision of Bonneville Power Administration to cease
hour-to-hour sales into California of between 600 MW and 1,000
MW that it had been making for the past week. According to BPA,
it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet
biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in
order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had
been telling California's Department of Water Resources that the
sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.

Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than
yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back.
Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because
of concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sending
exchange energy into California, however.

More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of the
Western Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter."
1876,allen-p,"Lucy,

Here is the rentroll.

My only questions are about #18, #25, and #37 missed rent.  Any special 
reasons?

It looks like there are five vacancies #2,12,20a,35,40.  If you want to run 
an ad in the paper with a $50 discount that is fine.
I will write you a letter of recommendation.  When do you need it?  You can 
use me as a reference.  In the next two weeks we should really have a good 
idea whether the sale is going through.

1878,allen-p,"Jacques,

I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of 
value and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able to 
use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, 
appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in 
extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like 
earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I 
didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear 
this up.

Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.  
Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and 
the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand, 
conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was 
clean.  What is your inclination?

Call as soon as you have a chance to review.

and architect to get things moving.  I am planning on  writing a personal 
check to the engineer while I am setting up new accounts.  Let me know if 
there is a reason I should not do this.

Thanks for all your help so far.  Between your connections and expertise in

Larrry,

I realize you are disappointed about the project.  It is not my desire for
you to be left with out of pocket expenses.  The only item from your list
that I need further
clarification is the $15,000 worth of extensions.  You mentioned that this
was applied to the cost of the land and it actually represents your cash
investment in the land.  I agree that you should be refunded any cash
investment.  My only request is that you help me locate this amount on the
closing statement or on some other document.

Thurs(3/23).  The kids are on spring break.  I will be in San Marcos and you 
can reach me on my cell phone 713-410-4679 or email pallen70@hotmail.com.

I was planning on stopping by to see Hugo Elizondo on Thursday to drop off a 
check and give him the green light to file for replatting.  What will change 
if we want to try and complete the project in phases.  Does he need to change 
what he is going to submit to the city.

I spoke to Gordon Kohutek this morning.  He was contracted to complete the 
soils study.  He says he will be done with his report by the end of the 
week.  I don't know who needs this report.  I told Gordon you might call to 
inquire about what work he performed. His number is 512-930-5832.

We spoke on the phone about most of these issues.

Something that I forgot to ask you.  Do you know if Hugo is planning to 
replatt using an administrative process which I understand is quicker than 
the full replatting process of 3 weeks?

Also let me know about the parking.  The builder in San Marcos believed the 
plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code.  The townhomes 
across the street have a serious parking problem.  They probably planned for 
the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms.

Phillip"

 Here is a photograhph of the house I have in mind.

 Specific features include:

 Wood stairs
 Two story porches on front and rear
 Granite counters in kitchens and baths
 Tile floors in upstairs baths
 Metal roof w/ gutters (No dormers)
 Cherry or Maple cabinets in kitchen & baths
 Solid wood interior doors
 Windows fully trimmed
 Crown molding in downstairs living areas
 2x6 wall on west side

 Undecided items include:

 Vinyl or Aluminum windows
 Wood or carpet in upstairs bedrooms and game room
 Exterior stucco w/ stone apron and window trim  or rough white brick on 3-4 
sides
 
 
 I have faxed you the floor plans.  The dimensions may be to small to read.  
The overall dimensions are 55' X 40'.  For a total of 4400 sq ft under roof, 
but 
 only 3800 of livable space after you deduct the garage.  

 Are there any savings in the simplicity of the design?  It is basically a 
box with a simple roof 
 line.  Call me if you have any questions. 713-853-7041.

Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates:

Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf 
(rentable)

What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent?

Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again?  You mentioned 2% 
overhead, 3 %  ???, and 5% profit.

Why is profit only 4%? 

Why are the architect fees up to $200K.  I thought they would be $80K.

What is the $617K of profit allowance?  Is that the developers profit to 
boost loan amount but not a real cost?

Total Closing and Application costs of 350K?  That seems very high?  Who 
receives the 2 points?  How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us?

Where is your 1%?  Are you receiving one of the points on the loan?

What is the status on the operating pro forma?  My back of the envelope puts 
NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40% 
expenses.  After debt service that would only leave $122K.  The coverage 
would only be 1.16.

Talk to you this afternoon.

Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and 
architect?  They have both sent me agreements.  The only payment
that George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect.  I have written 
personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the

Janie,

Thanks for the fax on SW Gas.

We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to 
discuss asset management.  In preparation for that meeting we would like to 
gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  
Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are 
typical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  
How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main 
contacts at SW Gas?

We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our 
control of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably 
have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the 
commissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their 
commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) 
should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month 
index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That 
risk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of 
their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.

As to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are 
there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly 
appreciated.

Thanks,

Laird"
1897,allen-p,"Reagan,

Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence.  Below is a 
list of questions on the specs:

1.  Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine?  Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less 
and cost about the same?

2.  What type of floor joist would be used?  2x12 or some sort of factory 
joist?

3.  What type for roof framing?  On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?

4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  What 
type of insulation in floors and ceiling?  Batts or blown?  Fiberglass or 
Cellulose?

5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?

6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't know 
the difference between an apron and a stool.

7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent 
cracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?

8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partial 
one out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.

9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under 
the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.

10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermount 
stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.

11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.

12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?

13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?

14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Iron 
railings?

15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price except 
for change orders?

I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but 
this is a start.  I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.  I am going to 
call Cary Kipp to
see about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.

Phillip
I"
1898,allen-p,"Cary,

Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple 
farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.  

A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:

There will be a double porch across the back just like the front
No dormers (Metal roof)
1/2 bath under stairs
Overall dimensions are 55 by 40


What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More cabinets, 
maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.    Reagan 
suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want to 
keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about bringing the 
left
side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.  That 
might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front porch 
would 
be smaller.

I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead and 
have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder.
I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned my 
alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed 
sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan 
allowed.

Cary,

Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple
farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.

A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:

There will be a double porch across the back just like the front
No dormers (Metal roof)
1/2 bath under stairs
Overall dimensions are 55 by 40


What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More
cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.
Reagan
suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want
to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about

I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts.

Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap?

What role would you play in obtaining financing?  Any experience with FHA 
221(d) loans?  

Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market 
quotes lower yet.  I have received estimates structured as follows:

  5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment
  2%- overhead
  4%- profit

I just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached an 
extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see even 
reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only 
generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about 
such a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down 
to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.  Any ideas?

I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you 
local connections.  I am not discounting those services.   I will be out of 
the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.

Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)"

Mike McDonald and I met with SW Gas this morning.  They were polite regarding 
asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to 
listen to a proposal.  However, they are very interested in weather hedges to 
protect throughput related earnings.  We are pursuing a confidentiality 
agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable 
us to develop proposals.  Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder 
value by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and by 
reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a 
weather product.

As to your other question.  We have yet to identify or pursue other 
candidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy 
to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our 
opportunities.  We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as we 
implement our strategy in California.

Are there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset 
management deal that we should approach?  Otherwise, we intend to 
systematically identify and work through all the candidates.

Subject: CAISO demand reduction

Phillip et al.,

I have been digging into the answer to your question re: demand reduction in 
the West.  Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. 
March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand 
over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for 
temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates 
into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as 
compared with the previous year.

Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary 
reductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other 
forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making 
total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  
This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple 
more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% 
decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the 
retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it 
is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last 
year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in 
Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation 
are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of 
meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general 
economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least 
make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.

Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area 
only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC 
(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO 
portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in 
demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As 
you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum 
smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at 
least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its 
wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several 
mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are 
sharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly 
how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  
Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's 
economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of 
the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I 
think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already 
realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the 
non-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the 
WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around 
6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.

I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you 
with updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I 
hope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any 
questions or need any further information."

Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic 
about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels 
into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my 
budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing 
the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.  
However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.

I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this 
product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you 
that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously 
consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in 
cost over stick built.

Phil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed

the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large

the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman 
began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or 
answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had 
some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:

Price caps are almost never the right answer
Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages
Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer
Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce 
demand, is not acceptable
Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would 
export California's problems to the West

This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty 
strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner 
out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and 
if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the 
agenda.  Hope this info helps.  Ray

Are there behind closed doors discussions being held prior to the meeting?  
Is there the potential for a surprise announcement of some sort of fixed 
price gas or power cap once the open meeting finally happens?"

1930,allen-p,"Tim,

Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our 
Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.

On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its 
forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been 
lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the 
second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The 
outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some 
additional insight?

Thank you,

Phillip"

Subject: 4-URGENT - OWA Please print this now.


Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute ""john.doe"" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in ""corp/your user 
id"" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack 
of Support
Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the 
bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a 
deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans 
and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is 
reportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and 
Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the 
bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double dip"" into 
the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and 
the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of 
the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  
Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term 
power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the 
bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of 
contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge 
loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very 
difficult.

The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state 
would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General 
Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 
billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this 
concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full 
disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the 
details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they 
will support the bond issuance to go forward.

Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB 
31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill 
passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of 
Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for 
community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be 
amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, 
currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should 
get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be 
likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). 
 
According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, 
Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money 
available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated 
that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  
Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The 
Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, 
Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and 
there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.
 
Key Points of the Bridge Financing
Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B
Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B
   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B
   Bear Stearns  $625 M
Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt
Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%
   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%
Current Projected 
Blended IR:  5.38%
Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001

Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time
The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the 
California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion 
authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be 
authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the 
additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing 
power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these 
authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the 
governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond 
amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to 
support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 
6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  
for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  
the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  
be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this 
idea  earlier in the crisis.
 
SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy
At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The 
first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the 
governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is 
August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According 
to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has 
signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis 
and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates 
that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary 
bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  

The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond 
issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) 
stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, 
then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the 
state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and 
passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for 
bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and 
the DWR proportionately from rate payments."

Western Power Spot Prices Sink Amid Weather-Related Demand

     Los Angeles, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Most Western U.S.
spot power prices for delivery tomorrow slumped as supply
outstripped demand.
     At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak
power dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt-
hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range.
     ""Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causing
prices to decline,"" said one Southwest trader.
     According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington
Massachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach
75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight.
     At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank
$202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 as
traders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range.
     Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawatt
Palo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increased
production to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of a
scheduled refueling outage that began March 31.
     At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power
slumped 47.5 percent from Friday's Sunday-Monday package to a
Bloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00.
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with cooling
demand 84 percent below normal.
     ""We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which is
causing temperatures to drop,"" said one Northwest trader.
     At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peak
power fell $189.39 to a Bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at
$175.00-$228.00.
     According the California Independent System Operator today's
forecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743
megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts.

Northeast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand

     Philadelphia, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- An increase in
available generation coupled with less weather-related demand,
caused next-day power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as much
as 11.3 percent this morning, traders said.
     According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,
temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree
Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and
cooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively.
     In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak
power scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg
volume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 from
Friday.
     ""There's just no weather out there,"" said one PJM-based
trader. ""There's no need for air conditioning, and no need for
heating. As far as I can tell, it's going to be that way all week
long.""
     Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000
megawatts through Friday.
     Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause for
the dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned to
service today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected to
hit the grid tomorrow.
     Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New York
Power Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2
nuclear power facilities.
     The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1
at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion of
a refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 at
full power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are owned

Weather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up

     Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peak
power prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as high
weather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast,
traders said.
     ""It's supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA (Tennessee
Valley Authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergy
to there,"" one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said.
""Dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because of
that.""
     The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesday
into the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose
$3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25
when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired.
     Cinergy power for Wednesday-Friday delivery sold at $39.00
and power for May 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from the
Southeast was expected to remain high into next week.
     Next-day power in TVA sold $2.15 higher on average at
$28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee,
forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday.
     ""Things should continue along these lines for the rest of
the week, because there's enough power to get down there but not
so much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices,"" an
ECAR trader said.
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, demand from
the Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up,
though traders said transmission problems limited volume.
     Peak Monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at the
Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50,
and $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, with
trades from $32.00-$40.00.
     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices also
climbed today, showing the largest increase in the region as
above-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problems
isolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs.
     For-Tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northern
MAPP at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southern
half of the region at $45.00-$52.00.
     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.
predicted tomorrow's high temperature would be 85 degrees in
Minneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska.
     ""There's no available transmission from ComEd, and problems
getting power out of Ameren's grid too,"" one MAPP trader said.
""It's likely to cause problems all week, since it's hot here and
down in SPP (the Southwest Power Pool).""

Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up

     Atlanta, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot
electricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned to
major Southern U.S. population centers, traders said.
     Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather
Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta
vicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5
degrees higher than today's projected high. Cooler weather is
expected to begin Wednesday.
     Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity,
temperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week,
propelling air conditioning demand, traders said.
      The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council
regional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour from
equivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to $37.20.
Trades ranged from $26.50-$42.50.
     On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded an
average of $2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of $34.44 amid
trades in the $28.00-$37.00 range.
     In Texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firm
energy to a Bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traders
complained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000.
     ""There's just no overnight load to do anything with the
supply we have,"" said one Texas-based utility power trader.
""Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree
(Fahrenheit) days. This year so far, the highest we've seen is
85 degrees, so that's about 10 degrees below normal for us.""
     On the Entergy Corp. grid, day-ahead peak power for
tomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00, though most trades were done
at a Bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than Friday. Traders
said forecasts for cooler weather through much of the South
starting Wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at
$35-$36.
     Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing day-ahead energy
at $37 from utilities in the Virginia-Carolinas region because
power from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC.
     Southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a Bloomberg
index of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range.
     In the forward power markets, Entergy power for the
balance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though later
trades were noted as high as $48.75. Balance-of-May Entergy
power was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traders
said.
     On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week was
bid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45. Firm energy for
the balance of May was discussed at $41, though no new trades
were noted.

U.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids

     London, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K.
fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy selling
interest, traders said.
     Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds a
megawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, before
closing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower than
Friday.
     The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start of
the month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from one
trading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it was
short. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from opposition
from another trading house, which bought the contract, supporting
price levels, traders said.
     Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather was
expected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower production
costs because of falling natural gas prices, traders said.
     June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday after
last trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour.
     On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gas
futures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15
pence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence since
the start of last week.
     Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamental
reasons for price movements because of the immaturity of the
market, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements.
Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels,
they said.

Nordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest

     Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-term
electricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker,
Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushed
to buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amid
limited hydro-supply, traders said.
     Winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an all
time high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00
megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.
Winter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50-
214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     ""The market crash everyone was waiting for never came; now
you have to pay higher prices to develop positions,'' an Oslo-
based trader said. ""I'm surprised that even at the peak of the
snow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices are
steadily climbing.''
     Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percent
above normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters.
Still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a ""more
realistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wet
outlooks.''
     Tuesday's system area average price was set below expecations
of 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour,
down 7.45 kroner from today's price. Still, traders said this was
a ""high'' spot price for this time of the year.
     Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hour
with 140 megawatts exchanged.
     Trade volumes on Nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatt-hours
generation, up 368 percent from Friday's 1,169 gigawatt-hours.

Subject: Transport p&l

Phillip--
I've noticed one thing on your intra-month transport p&l that looks strange 
to me.  Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be 
an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is 
O.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to 
get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and 
I'll take care of it..

On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate 
curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of 
$235,019.   
(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your 
overall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects 
something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal 
#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.
  139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)
  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)
  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)
  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)
  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)
 Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to 
GDP-Kingsgate.

 Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five 
different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for 
withdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a 
Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is 
that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport 
losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  
I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a 
systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems 
that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, 
the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the 
detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it 
appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be 
an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar 
impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in 
case there's something you want to do about it.  The columns below show the 
volumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each.

What do you think about being open until noon on Saturday.  This might be

Subject: Thoughts on Presentation

It is a shame that the CAISO doesn't provide actual generation by unit.  The 
WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, 
which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes 
the CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but 
there can be a siginificant difference between ""scheduled"" and ""actual"" 
generation.  You are pulling ""scheduled.""  If someone doesn't schedule their 
generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you 
will miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california 
munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, 
if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply 
schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said 
all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on 
the generation side.

On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While 
they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is 
better than the ""scheduled"" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the 
load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.

I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with 
others up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas 
demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, 
especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the 
UEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginal 
consumer then it is obviously a different story.

Let's talk."

Mark,

We are currently back-testing the storage model. 
The enclosed version contains deltas and decision 
variable. 

You mentioned that you have resources to run the model. Please do so.
This will help us to gain experience with the market vs the
model.

I am going to distribute an article by Caminus, an software vendor.
The article illustrates the optionality associated with storage operation
very well.  The Enron Research storage model  is a lot like that, although 
implementation may be
different.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: (Reminder) Update GIS Information

This is a reminder !!!  If you haven't taken the time to update your GIS 
information, please do so.  It is essential that this function be performed 
as soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days 
ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to 
call Ted Bland @ 3-5275.

With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees 
between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to 
have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee 
data.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the 
year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC 
requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their 
profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education 
need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is 
accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to 
hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com 
on the command line of your browser.

The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would 
like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned 
for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please 
contact Kathy Schultea at x33841.  

Your  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.

Here are the net open Socal border positions we have for Elvis and Cactus.  
Let's try and set up a conference call with Phillip and John to talk about 
their offers at the back-end of their curves.

Roughly speaking, we are looking at a nominal 3750 MMBtu/d for 14 years from 
May 2010 on Elvis, and 3000 MMBtu/d on Cactus fromJune 2004 to April 2022.

I am sending off a follow-up to a bid I submitted to Clark County PUD.  They 
have requested term pricing for Stanfield on a volume of 17,000.  Could you 
give me a basis for the period :

Sept -00 - May 31, 2006
Sept-00 - May 31, 2008

Since I assume you do not keep a Stanfield basis, but rather a basis off 
Malin or Rockies, it would probably make sense to show the basis as an 
adjustment to one of these point.  Also, what should the Mid - Offer Spread 
be on these terms.

Please plan to attend a meeting on Friday, August 11 at 11:15 a.m. in 30C1 to 
discuss the transportation model.  Now that we have had several traders 
managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss 
any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu 
(Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they 
will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this 
meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is 
comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those 
who are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have 
heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to 
discuss them.

Please let me know if you are unable to attend."

         us more important lessons than prosperity.

         will prove to be very educational--and in

	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

2002 IN REVIEW: NOT PERFECT, BUT IT SURE BEAT 2001

    Welcome to my 2002 Year in Review column, which
         I feel very safe in asserting you are reading
         here first. It's been a pretty good year, unless
         of course you hate Microsoft, love Linux,
         or were hoping HP and Compaq would unite. Read
         on for my highlights of the year that's about
         to happen.

    MS STALLING?... MORE JOBS IN 2002... CABLE WOES PERSIST...

    Could Microsoft be stalling? The nine
    states still pursing the software giant's
    antitrust case sure think so. They've
    asked a federal judge to reject Microsoft's
    request to delay the remedy hearings,
    though Microsoft says any holdup is
    the states' fault for seeking such a
    tough remedy.

2019,allen-p,"Phillip, there are a number of alternative systems that will allow the same
level of energy efficiency. I would wait a bit for Wink's bid though. You
say that your panel costs are $20,000 additional. that sounds like a lot. I
just did a panel house with a 2100 sq ft footprint and the total panel cost
was about $25,000 with 8 inch walls and 10 inch roof. Stay in touch and we
can discuss alternatives if that becomes necessary. If your budget is $85-90
per sq. ft.  excluding land costs your costs will be on the low end of the
true custom home level but should be achievable with good management.

Subject:


Richard,

I spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with
SIP's.  I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can
decide on a builder and materials.  I already have my blueprints
completed.  What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP's with
8.5"" roof panels and use a metal roof.

I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that
is also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of
$85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within
that budget.  I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built
house.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of a
radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same
energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to
a sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.
That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional
costs for the panels.  But would the foam insulation be as effective?
Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help
me construct the best home for the money.  I am trying to get a bid from
Wink with Premier based on you reference.

Thank you for your help.

Attached is the first draw request, I will need some of these funds immediately. I think checks out of Bishops Corner, L.P. may be the easiest, or you can wire money to me and I can write the checks when needed.  Please let me know how you wish to handle this and I will proceed.

Additionally, it is getting close to closing. I will need to get contracts signed at this point as soon as possible. We can handle this in two ways. I prefer that you elect me as a Vice - President of the General Partner and then I will sign all documents, or I can Federal Express contracts (this is more difficult).

My interpretation of this is that we made $1.2Bn total, half from new deals and the other half from reserve releases, and when you back out the prudency release you get back to zero net curve shift for 2001, which is what the original file had (approximately)

This section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out in the year following the termination event.  The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent.  As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent.  We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares).  If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares.  Please let me know you preference.

As you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt.  As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files.  He has become our department expert on the PSA account (much more knowledgeable than myself)  and the various plan provision amendments.  If you would like, we can set up a conference call with you, myself, and Larry to go over the payment methodology.  Please let me know a date and time that is convenient for you.

Renee,

Thank you for digging in to the issue of Deferred Phantom Stock Units.  It is clear that the payment will be made in shares.  However, I still don't understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares.  The plan document under VII.  Amount of Benefit Payments reads ""The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock.""  Can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers on my account.

Thank you,

We are still working on getting the information to post again correctly

2049,allen-p,"To our IBS Customers that are still hanging in there:

We understand your continued frustration and express our sincerest
apologies for our inability to give complete and accurate answers to
your questions. The problems that we are seeing are one of three (3)
possibilities:

1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was
the correct password) and been given the error message that you have
exceeded your opportunities for today, and you receive the message ""You
have failed to correctly login three times today; please try again
tomorrow, or contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password
reset."" This is the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one
quickly with you online (on the phone). Should you receive this message,
please call our Computer Department and ask for either myself (Howard
Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @ 830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @
830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail (or another employee), please
leave your Name, Account # and call back #.

2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the
ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the
last six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the
primary account holder.

3)  If you see this error message ""Invalid login; please try again""
(after three [3] or more tries), then you possibly fall into this last
category. Your account is one of the few that did not convert correctly
(we will not release any information about these accounts until we
verify that all information is correct and accurate). We are finalizing
these accounts today and should have them available for access this
afternoon (late) or this evening. Once we release these accounts for IBS
access, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn#
(this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will
be directed to a screen that asks for information such as:

Name
Address
City, State Zip+4
Phone #
E-Mail Address

After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be
instructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can
at this point change your password back to what it was before).  Always
remember that your password is case sensitive.

Should you get into IBS (before early evening [6:00pm]), the balance and
transactional information displayed is as of 11/16/01 (Friday night). We
will have this information updated by 6:00pm (hopefully), and then
information will be as of Monday (11/19/01). Again we want to thank you
for your patience through this (trying) ordeal, and we look forward to
continuing to service your IBS needs in the future.

Sincerely,

Good Morning! I hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving with your family and safe travels.

As per our meeting on Tuesday, please identify people you think will be good for the expert story roles. You can provide me a list and either contact them first or provide me with an introduction to get their commitment. Thanks a million in advance for your continued support of this project.

Subject:	SMEs for expert stories


Hello Kirk --

Hope you are doing well!

Just wanted to let you know that I will be taking over the role of
producint the expert stories for our simulation.  I understand you will be
obtaining the SMEs who will be providing us with expert stories.  Thank you
for your help.  Here are a few guidlines to keep in mind:

Number of SMEs needed:  10
Number of expert stories: 20-25
Characteristics: SME needs to be willing to speak in front of the camera, a
mix of structurers, originators and traders


I've included below a slightly revised version of the process that we will
follow for working with the SMEs to develop and film the stories.  The main
difference is that we need to get the list of SMEs by 11/28, instead of
11/30.  By 11/30, we need to have contacted the SMEs and set up time with
them for the following week. I think that to contact 10 SMEs will take at
least 2 days, especially since one of the days is a Friday.

(11/26-11/28)
                         --Obtain contact information for expert story SMEs
(11/28-11/30)
                         --Contact SMEs to give them background regarding
the simulation, describe their role in the simulation, set up a time to
discuss ideas, and set up a time for video shoot.
(12/3-12/6)
               --Meet with SMEs to discuss the categories of content we
need and where they can provide stories.
                          --Send follow-up e-mail asking SMEs to review the
stories (questions and answers) that we will ask them during the video
shoot.
                          --Make changes to stories, if necessary.
                          --Send final stories and video shoot logistics to
SMEs
(12/10-12/12)
                          --Video shoot

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Ann

Here are my very minor comments. However we still need to wait on any additions, based on meeting with SME's today. One concern is the firing of the learner who performs  bad in the final two scenarios. Do we face any copyright issues using the CNN type themes? In addition, I think we need to stay clear of anything that remotely seems like California or anything that really happen with Enron? (i.e. So-cal Waha) In addition, comments on regulatory issues may be a problem (i.e. California Legislature).

Sheri

When you read all the scripts together and due to the similar mechanics being taught it appears very repetitious. Thus I do believe we need to maybe use a ""Dateline"" type theme for one, and a ""60 Minute"" type theme for another scenario vice just the CNN type theme. In the last two scenarios can we include a promotion out of the associate program for the stellar performers (i.e. title change to manager)?

Kirk -

I have combined all of the storyline scripts (Intro and Scenarios 1-7) for
you to send to Legal for their review. Your comments were incorporated in
the scripts for scenarios 1 and 2.  We decided to refer to the company as
both Energy Incorporated and Energy Inc. rather than using E.I. so that
there is no confusion with Enron International. We will not have a coach
exit for scenario 5 until EOD tomorrow after the Ed meeting.  In reference
to your concern over ""locking in a price"" as collusion, those were
Phillip's words but we hope Legal will decide if we need to change them.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

The 3 SME's that have already committed to being on film need to be keep in the lope regarding the timeline. Also check with these 2 SME's for additional candidates (i.e. check with Mark Reese to see if Lamar Frazier would be interested). I would like to be conferenced in on the media calls & meetings.

Thank you for helping us work towards sign-off from Enron Legal. Seeing as
you haven't been closely involved, I thought you'd like an update on our
media production tasks.

As you know, we are completing our planning phase for the production of the
storyline scripts. Our media vendor, Cramer, has been extremely helpful and
enjoyable to work with.  Below is an email from Steve, the director for our
storyline video, explaining where we are in the production process.

Have a good day!

Hey Sheri,
I hope you had a great Thanksgiving! I can't believe it's over
already! Anyway...we've shuffled the schedule around, securing the 6th and
7th of
December for the shoot in the studio. We're working on finalizing the
edit dates to reflect that shift. Chris is moving to hold all talent for
those dates.

I guess it's now in the hands of legal! As soon as we confirm the edit
suite
availability
we'll revise and post the new schedule. We're scheduled for our weekly call
tomorrow but if
anything comes up just give me a buzz!
Thanks Sheri!
Steve

Hello Steve and Chris -

Recently, there were changes to the overall number of our scenarios in our
simulation. There will be seven scenarios versus the nine we have been
discussing. These changes result in:
        Deletion of 2 intro and 2 exit videos
        Deletion of six interview questions (see more detail below)
        No additional characters. We will still need all characters (and
        talent) that we have casted for.

Laura has been working with John to make the required edits to the scripts.
We have recieved today (mid-day).

Based on our last discussion, I'd like to recommend we set the date for our
shoot for the end of the first week in Dec. Specifically, Dec. 6th and 7th.
This recommendation is based on the response I received from our project
manager in regards to the time it will take to have Legal review our
scripts.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you and have a
wonderful Thanksgiving!

2059,allen-p,"Phillip, the insurance/repairs numbers are actually overstated; they are based on calculations from USPSL owners and agents like us who have helped clients buy and sell post offices for years. With regards to the exercising of renewal options, you might be interested to know that the USPS actually renews these 94% of the time; some post offices are in the 75 years and above range on leases. And finally, the construction  costs are reflective of the construction codes and practices the USPS requires for contractors. These are well-built facilities, last a long time, and can be converted to many other uses if the post office moves out.

I have added another post office for your consideration. It's in McAllen, is a multi-tenant building, and has a fairly strong cap rate. The flyer is attached.

In any case, I would be glad to help you look for other investment possibilities over here. Do let me know what you've already found, and what you might like to find. I look forward to hearing from you. With best regards, Jim Wills

Greg,

After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de=
ferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg=
arding the Phantom Stock Account. =20

Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis=
tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe=
nalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =
of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=
s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=
ceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=
 of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=
 of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=
rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=
s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=
ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=
res in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=
n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=
at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=
f Enron Corp. common stock.

There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=
  section 6.3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=
""  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=
ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=
t apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating ""a single sum distrib=
ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one pay=
ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.

The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =
is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=
he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states ""The val=
ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=
g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=
ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock"".=
  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=
 share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =
beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=
p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=
ction 6.3.

The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=
 distribution under each of the three interpretations:




Section 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1

Number of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=
es
Relative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13
Phantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658
10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866
Value to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792
Current stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10
Distribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares

I believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the =
administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7=
.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is =
a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. =

In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the=
 same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matt=
er.

Sincerely,

2066,allen-p,"For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.  

Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.

Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.  

      Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan."

2069,allen-p,"To all of our esteemed & prized Internet Banking  (IBS) Clients:

You probably have begun to wonder does anyone ever return phone calls
(or e-mails). We really do but have been holed up trying to complete
this project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we
found that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our
users back on-line.

We have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked
your additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This
process was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100
IBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and
confidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying
data and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of
you (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than
once or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want
displayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or
phone) the information to us and we will remove this information right
away.

To our IBS Billpayer clients:

During this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill
payment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring
payments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our
highest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the
process of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this
information. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the
months of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence
(and support).

Again, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and
ourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be
one of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account
information, please refer to the following information:

1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was
the correct password) and been given the error message ""You have failed
to correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or
contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset."" This is
the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you
online (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). Should you
receive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for
either myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @
830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail
(or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back
#.

2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the
ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the
last six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the
primary account holder. Since we have released these accounts for IBS
access, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn#
(this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will
be directed to a screen that asks for information such as:

Name
Address
City, State Zip+4
Phone #
E-Mail Address

After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be
instructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can
at this point change your password back to what it was before).  Always
remember that your password is case sensitive.

Again we want to thank you for your patience through this (trying)
ordeal, and we look forward to serving your IBS needs in the future.

Sincerely,

Howard Gordon
Network Manager

Western Power Prices Fall With Warmer Weather, Natural Gas Loss

     Los Angeles, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Western spot
power prices declined today from a combination of warmer weather
across the region and declining natural gas prices.
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average about 2 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal for the next seven days. In the Southwest
temperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal.
     At the California-Oregon Border, heavy load power fell
$172.00 from yesterday to $430.00-$475.00.
     ""What happened to all of this bitter cold weather we were
supposed to have,'' said one Northwest power marketer. Since the
weather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower.""
     Temperatures in Los Angeles today will peak at 66 degrees,
and are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend.
     Natural gas to be delivered to the California Oregon from the
El Paso Pipeline traded between $20-$21, down $3 from yesterday.
     ""Gas prices are declining causing western daily power prices
to fall,'' said one Northwest power trader.
     At the NP-15 delivery point heavy load power decreased
$206.25 from yesterday to $325.00-$450.00. Light load energy fell
to $200.00-$350.00, falling $175.00 from yesterday.
     PSC of New Mexico's 498-megawatt San Juan Unit 4 coal plant
was shut down this morning for a tube leak. The unit is scheduled
to restart this weekend.
     At the Four Corners located in New Mexico, power traded at
$325.00-$335.00 plunging $182.50 from yesterday.

PJM Spot Power Prices Dip With Weather, Falling Natural Gas

     Philadelphia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak next-day
power prices declined at the western hub of the Pennsylvania-New
Jersey-Maryland Interconnection amid warmer weather forecasts and
falling natural gas prices, traders said.
     The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power at western
PJM declined an average of $12.75 a megawatt-hour, with trades
ranging from $62.00-$76.00.
     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.
forecast tomorrow's high temperature in Philadelphia at 40 degrees
Fahrenheit, up 7 degrees from today's expected high. Temperatures
could climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday.
     ""Most of the day's activity took place in the early part of
the morning,"" said one PJM-based trader. ""By options expiration
the market had pretty much dried up.""
     Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the main
reason for the decline in spot market prices.
     Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to the
New York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per million
British thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. Since
Monday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of
$2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecasts
indicated reduced utility load requirements.
     In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies they
normally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weather
forecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets.
     Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13
higher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the
$67.00-$75.00 range. Power at Zone J sold $7.50 higher at $90.00-
$92.00.

Mid-Continent Power Prices Drop on Revised Forecast, Gas Prices

     Cincinnati, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continent
next-day peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revised
warmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said.
     The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power on the
Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system dropped $23.19
to $67.90 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $75.00 as the
market opened down to $59.00 after options expired.
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power on
the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison Co. grid sold $21.37 lower
on average at $60.00-$75.00, while power in lower MAIN sold $18.17
lower at $65.00-$100.00.
     Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc. predicted
high temperatures would average 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal
in Chicago and at normal levels in Cincinnati over the next seven
days, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal Monday, respectively.
     Traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulled
prices down. Natural gas prices were a large factor in recent
electricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-fired
generation to meet increased weather-related demand.
     Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an average
of 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million British
thermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an average
of 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu.
     ""The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've got
people coming to their senses,"" one trader said. ""These are much
more realistic prices.""
     Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if the
outlook for weather continues to be mild. Peak Cinergy power for
delivery from Dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00
yesterday.
     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices plunged
with warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmission
capacity, selling $37.67 less in northern MAPP and $44.17 less in
southern MAPP at $75.00-$125.00.
     ""What's happening is the people who don't have firm
transmission are getting into the market early and buying at those
high prices since they have no choice,"" one MAPP trader said.
     ""Then you've got some people who were lucky enough to get a
firm path who waited until later in the morning when ComEd prices
fell off,"" he said, ""and bought from them at those lower prices,
causing the huge gap between the day's high and low trade.""

Southeast U.S. Electricity Prices Slump After Mild Forecast

     Atlanta, Georgia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Southeast
U.S. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather was
forecast for the region this week, traders said.
     Traders said Southeast utility demand has been reduced since
many large population centers like Atlanta will see temperatures
climb into the mid-50s Fahrenheit later this week.
     ""There was nothing going on in Florida today,"" said one
southern energy trader. ""Everything was going to markets in the
north.""
     Traders said supply was being routed from Florida into
markets on the Entergy Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority
grid in the mid-$70s a megawatt-hour.
     ""Prices into TVA started in the $80s and $90s and crumbled as
forecasts came out,"" said on Entergy power trader. ""Prices,
declined to $60 and less.""
     The Bloomberg into TVA index price fell an average of $23.95
to $70.25 amid trades in the $65.00-$80.00 range. Off-peak trades
were noted at $32.00, several dollars higher than recent
estimates.
     Southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weather
forecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week
caused prices to decline in the region.
     In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather was
the main culprit behind lower prices.
     ""The cold weather's backing off,"" said one SPP utility
trader. ""It was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday and
today it's about 9 degrees with the wind chill.  Yesterday, it was
bitter cold and today it was just plain cold.""
     Power sold in northern sections of SPP at $78-$100, though
the Bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to $88.00. Southern
SPP traded at $82.00, $2 more than yesterday.

U.K. Day-Ahead Electricity Prices Rise Amid Increased Demand

     London, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity prices in
the U.K. rose today after falling temperatures were expected to
increase household consumption for space heating, traders said.
     The day-ahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by the
Electricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01
pounds a megawatt-hour.
     Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degrees
to 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather Services
Corp. in the U.S.
     Day-ahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15
pounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday.
     December continued to fall amid a combination of position
closing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will
not rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said.
     December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds a
megawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday's last trade.
     First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with
expectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue
to stifle demand, traders said.
     January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds a
megawatt-hour, falling 17 pence.
     First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds a
megawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close.
     Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer
2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour.
Winter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a
megawatt-hour.
     Open positions on many short-term structures will likely
force many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run-
up to Christmas, traders said. Adding that other structures will
probably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more
easily be assessed.

Nordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast

     Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices
on the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher today
as colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said.
     Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt-
hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday's closing trade on 1,076
megawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446
megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede after
forecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia for
next week. These producers typically generate power to prevent
reservoirs from overflowing.
     Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise
with falling temperatures because of increased requirements for
space heating.
     Traded volume on the power exchange increased in active
trading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders
said.
     ""The market's been waiting for this day for a long time,"" a
Stockholm-based trader said. ""For too long, people have been
selling because winter hasn't lived up to expectations. We should
now see a noticeable increase in the spot price.""
     Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fall
below freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limited
chances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to Weather
Services Corp. in the U.S.
     The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand was
expected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict
temperatures to begin falling.
     Thursday's system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22
percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell
4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts.
     Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise
by 10-15 kroner by the start of next week.
     Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter-
term contracts.
     Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour,
1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner a
megawatt-hour.
     Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, although
expected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producers
to meet the increased demand, other traders said.
     Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor,
will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said.
     Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used
today's news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said.

2076,allen-p,"Phillip -- Is the value axis on Sheet 2 of the ""socalprices"" spread sheet 
supposed to be in $?  If so, are they the right values (millions?) and where

As I told Mike, we will file this out-of-time tomorrow as a supplement to our

Subject: REVISION - - LOAD AND RESOURCE ESTIMATES


Most control areas have now reported the amount of load relief and generation 
increase that was experienced over the Peak period (17:00-18:00 PST) on 
December 12.  The data I have received thus far are summarized in the 
following paragraphs.

The approximate amount of load relief achieved due to conservation or 
curtailments over the Peak period on December 12 was 835 MWh.

The approximate amount of generation increase due to extraordinary operations 
or purchases over the Peak period on December 12 was 786 MWh.

A note of caution, these figures are very imprecise and were derived with a 
lot of guesswork.  However, they should be within the ballpark of reality.

Western Power Spot Prices Sink Amid Weather-Related Demand

     Los Angeles, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Most Western U.S.
spot power prices for delivery tomorrow slumped as supply
outstripped demand.
     At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak
power dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt-
hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range.
     ""Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causing
prices to decline,"" said one Southwest trader.
     According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington
Massachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach
75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight.
     At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank
$202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 as
traders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range.
     Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawatt
Palo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increased
production to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of a
scheduled refueling outage that began March 31.
     At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power
slumped 47.5 percent from Friday's Sunday-Monday package to a
Bloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00.
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with cooling
demand 84 percent below normal.
     ""We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which is
causing temperatures to drop,"" said one Northwest trader.
     At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peak
power fell $189.39 to a Bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at
$175.00-$228.00.
     According the California Independent System Operator today's
forecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743
megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts.

Northeast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand

     Philadelphia, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- An increase in
available generation coupled with less weather-related demand,
caused next-day power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as much
as 11.3 percent this morning, traders said.
     According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,
temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree
Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and
cooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively.
     In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak
power scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg
volume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 from
Friday.
     ""There's just no weather out there,"" said one PJM-based
trader. ""There's no need for air conditioning, and no need for
heating. As far as I can tell, it's going to be that way all week
long.""
     Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000
megawatts through Friday.
     Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause for
the dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned to
service today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected to
hit the grid tomorrow.
     Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New York
Power Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2
nuclear power facilities.
     The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1
at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion of
a refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 at
full power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are owned
and operated by Niagara Mohawk.
     Zone J, which comprises New York City, slipped $4.50 to
$58.50, while Zones G and A fell $3.25 and $5.50, respectively, to
$51.25 and $40.00 indices.

Weather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up

     Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peak
power prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as high
weather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast,
traders said.
     ""It's supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA (Tennessee
Valley Authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergy
to there,"" one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said.
""Dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because of
that.""
     The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesday
into the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose
$3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25
when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired.
     Cinergy power for Wednesday-Friday delivery sold at $39.00
and power for May 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from the
Southeast was expected to remain high into next week.
     Next-day power in TVA sold $2.15 higher on average at
$28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee,
forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday.
     ""Things should continue along these lines for the rest of
the week, because there's enough power to get down there but not
so much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices,"" an
ECAR trader said.
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, demand from
the Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up,
though traders said transmission problems limited volume.
     Peak Monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at the
Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50,
and $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, with
trades from $32.00-$40.00.
     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices also
climbed today, showing the largest increase in the region as
above-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problems
isolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs.
     For-Tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northern
MAPP at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southern
half of the region at $45.00-$52.00.
     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.
predicted tomorrow's high temperature would be 85 degrees in
Minneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska.
     ""There's no available transmission from ComEd, and problems
getting power out of Ameren's grid too,"" one MAPP trader said.
""It's likely to cause problems all week, since it's hot here and
down in SPP (the Southwest Power Pool).""

Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up

     Atlanta, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot
electricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned to
major Southern U.S. population centers, traders said.
     Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather
Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta
vicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5
degrees higher than today's projected high. Cooler weather is
expected to begin Wednesday.
     Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity,
temperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week,
propelling air conditioning demand, traders said.
      The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council
regional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour from
equivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to $37.20.
Trades ranged from $26.50-$42.50.
     On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded an
average of $2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of $34.44 amid
trades in the $28.00-$37.00 range.
     In Texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firm
energy to a Bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traders
complained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000.
     ""There's just no overnight load to do anything with the
supply we have,"" said one Texas-based utility power trader.
""Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree
(Fahrenheit) days. This year so far, the highest we've seen is
85 degrees, so that's about 10 degrees below normal for us.""
     On the Entergy Corp. grid, day-ahead peak power for
tomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00, though most trades were done
at a Bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than Friday. Traders
said forecasts for cooler weather through much of the South
starting Wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at
$35-$36.
     Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing day-ahead energy
at $37 from utilities in the Virginia-Carolinas region because
power from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC.
     Southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a Bloomberg
index of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range.
     In the forward power markets, Entergy power for the
balance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though later
trades were noted as high as $48.75. Balance-of-May Entergy
power was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traders
said.
     On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week was
bid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45. Firm energy for
the balance of May was discussed at $41, though no new trades
were noted.

U.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids

     London, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K.
fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy selling
interest, traders said.
     Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds a
megawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, before
closing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower than
Friday.
     The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start of
the month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from one
trading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it was
short. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from opposition
from another trading house, which bought the contract, supporting
price levels, traders said.
     Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather was
expected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower production
costs because of falling natural gas prices, traders said.
     June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday after
last trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour.
     On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gas
futures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15
pence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence since
the start of last week.
     Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamental
reasons for price movements because of the immaturity of the
market, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements.
Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels,
they said.

Nordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest

     Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-term
electricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker,
Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushed
to buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amid
limited hydro-supply, traders said.

time high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00
megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.

steadily climbing.''
     Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percent

realistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wet

of 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour,

a ""high'' spot price for this time of the year.

I don't understand what you want me to do with this letter.  Regarding the utilities,  you and I know that I have had the right to shut off the utilities to a property I don't own for sometime now.  I did not do that because I wanted to stay on good terms with the Kuo's while negotiating the release.  I had the utilities taken out of my name yesterday.  The city of seguin informs me that the meters were read yesterday and the final bill will be mailed to me next week.  Then I can compute the amount that the Kuo's owe me for utilities and send them a check for the rock repairs.  Please let Pauline know that she needs to go down to the city and take care of the deposit by Friday or the power may be disconnected.  The utilities are already in her name.

In my mind the utilities were never a bargaining chip.  Rather, you and I are paying the $11,000 in exchange for the release.  Regarding the transfer of ownership into a limited partnership, I will most likely be agreeable to this but I want to review all the loan documents with Jacques and ensure that there is still a personal guarantee on the two notes.  I expect to have that done by Friday.

I would like for her to sign the release today, but if she won't sign until I consent to the limited partnership then the release will have to wait until Friday.  As far as the utilities go,  I made the transfer for two reasons: 1) I need to know the amount that I have paid to net against the $11,000 and 2) I had the right to take the utilities out of my name and I didn't want the balance to get out of hand.

I will call you when I am comfortable consenting to the limited partnership.

Here is a short letter that indicates I will give consent contingent to the items we discussed.  I didn't make any reference to why I took the utilities out of my name.
I left that for you to explain to her that we need to have a cutoff date so we can calculate the final amount.  I hope you can make her understand that I have not been obligated to keep these in my name for some time.  Since my attorney is out of town until Monday and I doubt that she has all the documents in place to actually place the property in a limited partnership (certainly not the 1st lienholders consent) we will have to work together next week.

2129,allen-p,"Carlos,

Can you help me with several 1031 exchange questions?  I spoke to your office and they thought it best that I address my questions to you directly.  

Here is my situation.  I purchased a 32 acre tract in Leander about 8 months ago.  I have a contract to sell the property which should close around July 18th.  

I expect to realize a gain of around $400,000.  See calculations below:

Sales price:		2,100,000
Purchase price		1,200,000
Fees&Devel costs	  500,000

Profit			 400,000

The cash generated at the sale will be close to $1 million after repayment of a loan.

I am interested in protecting this gain through a 1031 exchange.

I am already involved in a couple of other real estate transactions that might qualify. 

 First, there is a 10 acre tract that was purchased by Bishops Corner, Ltd for $1.15 million six months ago.  I lent the partnership the cash to buy the land with the intent of working with the developer to build a multifamily project.  We could not come to terms for the development, so the partnership was conveyed to me.  The loan still exist.  I am an 80% limited partner.  Another investor is the other limited partner.  We have set up a Corporation to be the general partner.  We intend to develop the property. Is there a creative way to use the land purchase in a 1031 exchange?

Second,  I have a small tract in New Braunfels under contract for $400,000.  I am applying for FHA financing for a 180 unit apartment complex and hope to receive an invitation letter prior to closing.  I would need to place this property in a limited partnership eventually, but is there a way to buy the property hold it in my name long enough to satisfy the IRS then move it to a LP.

If neither of these deals qualify, I would still like to find another piece of property.  My two biggest concerns are tying up too much cash and holding property in my own name.  Is there a way to insure during the 1st year then move a different entity?

Thank you in advance for your help.

Two items:

1.  I spoke to John McKay about Sumas.  His views seem well thought out.  He is short the summer due to the prospect of another 200,000+/day of supply coming back by July 1st.  See attached spreadsheet.  In order to displace Aeco gas coming down to Kingsgate his target for Sumas value is AECO -0.10.  But since his forecast for Aeco is that they will have 30 BCF left in storage at the end of March and current cash is trading down 0.70 or wider versus a rest of summer curve around down 0.50, he is expecting the AECO curve to widen to down 0.85.  Therefore, his ultimate target for Sumas is down 0.95 versus the current market of down 0.40
	His winter Sumas shorts are based on his analysis of total supply capacity versus peak demand. See attached spreadsheet.  Sumas still commands the premium of an isolated market during the winter but the supply numbers don't  support that premium.
	In conclusion, I think I will sell some more summer sumas for my book.


 
2.  I will stay after the meeting to talk about Mike G's issues."

El Paso Merchant filed comments yesterday in the Reporting Requirements docket.  They did not argue against the collection of the new proposed data, but rather argued that the Commission needed to add to the information to be gathered to include financial market data.  El Paso states that the financial market is believed to be ten times as large as the physical market.  El Paso suggests the following information be collected:
the name of the counter party to the financial trade
the quantitiy of gas underlying the financial trade
all the pricing terms of the trade stated in price per MMBtu
the time period of the trade, including starting and ending dates
the date on which the deal was entered into
the type of trade

El Paso Merchant also argues for confidential treatment and a sunset date for the collection of the data (tied to when EIA finds supply and demand in California in balance.)

Is the problem that the energy DWR purchased is above market and not needed by CORE  or  just above market.  If the energy is needed by CORE wouldn't the deals just be blended in as costs like utility gen and QF supply?  If the energy is not needed now could the state sell back the excess then compute the exact loss and put a surcharge on rates for all or some customers that recoup that amount over time.  Once again there would be a CTC type recovery period but there would not be the risk that the market price must stay below a fixed price for the stranded costs to be recovered.

Subject:	Call to Discuss Possible Options to Mitigate Effect of DWR Contracts--Privileged and Confidential
Sensitivity:	Confidential

PLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE, AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL.

As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's electricity crisis.
In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States Petroleum Association, and Enron.
The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg).
When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers).
In effect, ""core"" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers would go to market.  
The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03.
The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January and today remain very contentious).
Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the contracts.
The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR contracts.  Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost.
Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to address ""the DWR contract problem"" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not include Direct Access.
Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any ""out clauses"" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract provisions.  (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that ""outs"" for the state are minimal or nonexistent.)
In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might reform the contracts.
All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyone's contract rights.

We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the core/noncore solution alive.  We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM PDT.  Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.

Thanks,
Jeff"

Jim, 

Following up on the message I left you, I thought I'd send you some of the basic information on the Crossroads project to see if you have any interest in that area:

The facility will be a high flexibility, bedded salt cavern
Initial startup is expected in summer 2002 with 2 bcf working gas, eventual rampup to 3 bcf 
75 MMCF/D injection (at 2 bcf working)
200 MMCF/D withdrawal (at 2 bcf working)
Located near Brush, Colorado, in Morgan County.
Located at far east end of PSCo system, 7 miles from CIG and 10 miles from Kinder Morgan

This is all the information I have at the moment, in addition to some maps which you are welcomed to look at.  Garry Wilson and I will be meeting with the developer in Denver on Monday, but he'd like to see if we have interest sooner than that.  I apologize for the last-minute nature of the request, but we were just hoping for an initial gauge of your interest.  

Do you have any use for this capacity?  If so, at what price?  What would your timing requirements be?  Would you have any other conditions that would increase interest in this capacity?

Thanks for your attention.  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions, I'll try following up with you tomorrow if you ahve any free time.  Thanks!

Have you received the assignment letter from Marcus Kolb.  This letter makes it sound like the assumption is just between the Kuo's and Success Real Estate.  Don't they need something signed from Southern Pacific Bank?

I noticed in the san macos record that some zoning changes were underway.  =
First, I wanted to make sure our property would not be affected.  Second, p=
art of the land that is being rezoned is targeted for ""seniors"".  I would l=
ike to explore the possibility of developing a seniors project ( not assist=
ed living). Maybe we could look at the property mentioned below.   As I hav=

Sector 2 plan geets boost from council  By MURLIN EVANS - Staff Reporter  H=
ome and landowners in northwestern San Marcos will soon have a revised futu=
re land use plan to consult for development in the area.  The San Marcos Ci=
ty Council on first reading unanimously approved changes to its Sector Two =
Land Use Plan -- changes over a year in the making and covering a 1.26 squa=
re mile area -- intended to encourage development that is both acceptable a=
nd appropriate for the region.  Significant to the revisions are those affe=
cting a controversial tract owned by resident Jack Weatherford at the corne=
r of Ranch Road 12 and the newly named Craddock Avenue (Bishop Street).  We=
atherford filed suit against the city earlier this year as a result of vari=
ous city commissions declining to approve re-zoning plans the landowner say=
s were in synch with land uses deemed acceptable in the current Sector Two =
plan.  Proposed changes to Weatherford's 54 acre tract -- which have no dir=
ect effect on existing zoning -- deletes the 10 acres of high density resid=
ential allowed in the current plan and adds instead two additional acres of=
 commercial, one additional acre of medium density residential, and seven a=
dditional acres of low density residential.  In addition, the total eight a=
cres of the Weatherford tract proposed for medium density residential is su=
ggested limited to town home, single-family, or multi-family senior housing=
 development in the revised future land use plan.  The total 10 acres of co=
mmercial allowed on the property is proposed limited to ""community commerci=
al"" -- a yet to be established zoning district -- loosely defined as to ens=
ure more compatibility with existing residential neighborhoods complete wit=
h buffering and landscaping.  A 50 foot greenbelt buffer is also proposed t=
o separate the commercial areas from residential ones in the revised plan. =
 However, a curb cut envisioned to access this property from RR 12 drew som=
e concern from council members over the potential traffic hazards it may po=
se on the busy state highway.  Proposed are two curb cuts, one accessing th=
e proposed Weatherford commercial area from RR 12 and one from Craddock Ave=
nue.  While the state highway department and city would have input into the=
 plans for where the eventual curb cut would go, city planning director Ron=
 Patterson said the allowance of the two curb cuts was a compromise between=
 the wishes of area landowners and Weatherford.  Council member Jane Hughso=
n supported the idea of removing the RR 12 curb cut allowance from the Sect=
or Plan, but evaluating a developer's plans for possibly locating one in th=
e area as development proceeds.  ""I'd rather say ""no' and if someone comes =
us with a really good idea, look at it then,"" Hughson said.  Councilman Ed =
Mihalkanin expressed similar safety concerns over the final placement of th=
e curb cut.  ""It seems to me we're asking for a bunch of accidents to happe=
n there,"" Mihalkanin said.  A motion by Hughson to amend the plan to exclud=
e curb cuts from RR 12 into the property failed on a 3-3 tie vote with San =
Marcos Mayor David Chiu and council members Joe Cox and Paul Mayhew voting =
against the move. Council member Martha Castex Tatum was not present at the=
 meeting.  Curb cuts or not, the Sector Two Plan earned support from severa=
l residents and neighborhood representatives, who said the plan was a good =
compromise.  Oak Heights resident John McBride, who has been an active crit=
ic and participant in the Sector Two revision process, especially concernin=
g the Weatherford tract, said the revised plan better served the interests =
of the city as a whole.  ""This is not a victory for one side or the other,""=
 said McBride, alluding to a fallout between neighborhood groups opposed to=
 Weatherford's initial plans for his property, ""but a victory for the City =
of San Marcos. We started out with all R-1...we've come a long way."" =09

Yes they do need to get approval from Southern Pacific Bank.  Their attorney

I spoke with their attorney this AM, and he said that he is reviewing the
settlement document and will like to get everything settled before he leaves
on vacation. (even though he has had the document for a month?)

I suggested that he talk to Jacques to speed the process up.  Pauline may

You should probably have Jacques speak with their attorney (Kolb) if he does

I sent a copy of an article discussing oil and gas stocks.  The main idea was that everyone is selling so it is probably a good time to be buying.  I had lost your email so I sent it to Gary and asked him to forward it to you.  I guess he is technology challenged.  The article was just one analyst's opinion.  He can find dozens of articles just like it online.  It was not important.

On a different note, Kelsey is at T Bar M camp this week.  Heather is very anxious about this.  The only info we get is through the camp's website.  Each day they post candid pictures from the prior day.  We scan through to try and spot Kelsey.  So far we have found her in one picture each day.  It is kind of fun trying to find her.  If you want to give it a try, go to their website at  www.tbarmcamps.org/index.shtml <http://www.tbarmcamps.org/index.shtml> .  Click on sports camp parent connection.  There are a few paragraphs about each day and a spot to click for the pictures from that day.  See if you can find her.

Pat and Gary's house looks like it is taking shape fast.  The Meckels seem to do good work.  I might have to reconsider using them for our house.
We should be in town Friday.  We have to be at the camp at 8:30 on Saturday.  See you soon.

El Paso Announces Binding Open Season for Additional Capacity on Line 2000

HOUSTON, July 10 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Natural Gas Company, a subsidiary of El Paso Corporation (NYSE: EPG - news), announced today a binding open season for 320 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of pipeline capacity from the Keystone and Waha areas of the Permian Basin in West Texas to the California border near Ehrenberg, Arizona. The binding open season, which began July 5, 2001 and closes on August 2, 2001, is in response to the interest expressed during El Paso's non-binding open season in March 2001 soliciting shippers for potential system expansions.

The expansion capacity will be made available by adding compression to El Paso's Line 2000 from McCamey, Texas to the California border near Ehrenberg, Arizona. The expansion capacity will be sold at El Paso's existing maximum California tariff rate, and the fuel charge is estimated to be 5 percent. The projected in-service date of the expansion facilities is mid-2003 subject to the receipt of all necessary regulatory, environmental, and right-of-way authorizations.

The receipt points on El Paso's system for this capacity will be the Waha and Keystone pools in the Permian Basin area of West Texas. The delivery points will be Southern California Gas Company (SoCal) and PG&E's proposed North Baja Pipeline, El Paso's bi-directional lateral (Line 1903), any future incremental capacity on the SoCal system from Ehrenberg, Arizona into the State of California, and any upstream points on El Paso's south mainline system where capacity exists.

``This system expansion will add incremental interstate capacity to California, Arizona, New Mexico, and West Texas to meet increasing natural gas demands including the demand for natural gas to generate electricity for the western United States,'' said Patricia A. Shelton, president of El Paso Natural Gas Company.

Interested parties can contact their transportation marketing representative or Mr. Jerry W. Strange at (719) 520-4687.

El Paso Corporation is committed to meeting energy needs throughout North America and the world with operations that span the energy value chain from wellhead to electron. The company is focused on speeding the development of new technologies, such as clean coal and liquefied natural gas, to address critical energy shortages across the globe.

Hunter, Scott, Tom & Barry,
We have been meeting with the Ocean Energy, Inc. (""OEI"") management team over the last several months discussing the asset management of OEI's gas, as well as  Enron's ability to provide additional Producer Services (including the operations of certain pipeline facilities, outsourcing services and Enron systems outsourcing). We are moving forward with the project and have divided it into two phases. Phase 1: will be the purchase of OEI's natural gas in North America, both operated and non-operated properties, and Phase 2: will evaluate the opportunity to provide OEI additional services. 
For Phase 1, OEI is soliciting bids for their North American supply for the period beginning on October 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002. Bids on this gas are due August 15, 2001, with expected daily production for the bid cycle to exceed 450,000 MCF/d of natural gas. The gas is currently under contract to Duke Energy  until September 30, 2001. 
Phase 2 will follow a parallel path. We are continuing to have meetings with OEI to discuss our Producer One product as well as evaluating OEI's Havre Pipeline system in Montana for a pipeline outsourcing opportunity. 
OEI is one of the largest independent oil and gas exploration and production companies in the United States with proved reserves of 460 million barrels of oil equivalent. North American operations are focused in the shelf and deepwater areas of the Gulf of Mexico, South and East Texas, and the Mid-continent, Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain regions. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, OEI has interests in more than 300 Gulf of Mexico blocks, including 83 in the deepwater. They plan to spend $300 to $350 million in 2001 to grow its reserve base through delineation of recent discoveries and additional deepwater exploration.  Ocean's deepwater expenditures will include continued development of its commercial discoveries, including the Nansen and Boomvang projects in the East Breaks area and the Magnolia discovery on Garden Banks Block 783. They will continue to be aggressive in the drilling of its inventory of core shelf holdings. 
The North America Onshore division of Ocean Energy is organized into five operating regions: the Rocky Mountains, Permian Basin, Arklatex, Anadarko and East Texas. In 2001, Ocean Energy plans to grow production and reserves from its long-life assets while increasing its number of high-potential exploration prospects in core areas, including the Bossier Play in East Texas and the Permian Basin. 
This opportunity will provide gas across North America for Enron with the majority of the gas supply located in the GOM. Once we complete our due diligence on the properties, we will be working with structuring, the wellhead desk and each of the respective desks to request  bids for each of the gas packages.
The attached file will give you an idea of the location and volume of the gas available in Phase 1. Also included on the spreadsheet is a pricing reference point for each package. If you have any questions regarding this opportunity, please contact me at X-36784.

I finally got in touch with the department that handles stock options.  Unfortunately, they are committed to Paine Webber for the foreseeable future.  The two primary reasons they gave for not wanting to explore a new relationship were an exclusive contract with Paine Webber and the reporting and tax interfaces that are already in place.  They are less concerned with the services that Paine Webber doesn't offer the employees such as lending against vested options.  

It was worth a try.

Subject:	CA Instrate Gas matters

This is to quickly summarize our call on July 11 on California gas intrastate matters and set a direction for future activity.

Unbundling:	 PG&E has a Gas Accord in effect through 12/31/03, which is generally positive.  We will participate in the development of a successor plan, and attempt to improve it if we can.
  		SoCalGas attempted its own version of a gas accord, but the CPUC refused to approve.  We will attempt to resurrect this accord and obtain CPUC approval. 

Hedging:  No proceeding currently exists to address gas hedging by LDCs.  (draft legislation does exist on the electric side to allow hedging and passthrough of costs).

Subject:	CA Instrate Gas matters

This is to quickly summarize our call on July 11 on California gas intrastate matters and set a direction for future activity.

Unbundling:	 PG&E has a Gas Accord in effect through 12/31/03, which is generally positive.  We will participate in the development of a successor plan, and attempt to improve it if we can.
  		SoCalGas attempted its own version of a gas accord, but the CPUC refused to approve.  We will attempt to resurrect this accord and obtain CPUC approval. 

Hedging:  No proceeding currently exists to address gas hedging by LDCs.  (draft legislation does exist on the electric side to allow hedging and passthrough of costs).  Jeff has recommended that we approach the LDCs to begin discussing the issue and developing a strategy to take to the CPUC.  I suggest we develop an ENA-EES hedging proposal for CA and then take that to the LDCs.  I will attempt to put this is writing.

On Friday, July 13th, a shipper group filed a complaint against El Paso Nat=
ural Gas alleging that the pipeline has oversold capacity into California d=
ue in part to unlimited growth of demands by full requirements customers.  =
The complainants request:

(1) that all full requirements customers be converted to contract demand cu=
stomers at reasonable levels;

(2) a mandatory expansion of the pipeline system to be used to meet El Paso=
's existing firm transportation obligations; and

(3) that FERC prohibit El Paso from collecting demand charges for firm serv=
ice it is unable to provide until such time as El Paso can show that it is =
capable of meeting its firm service obligations.

A Technical Conference in El Paso's Order No. 637 proceeding (RP00-336) is =
scheduled for Wed., July 18, 2001 to discuss El Paso's systemwide capacity =
allocation issues, which will include topics addressed in the complaint.=20"

Yes, it's true, suggest SG Cowen media analysts Ed Hatch, Peter Mirsky and Eric Handler, in this week's Media Money Manager. Automobile advertising is the largest category in domestic consumer media spending and accounts for about 17%, or $15 billion, the stock studiers say, using data from Competitive Media Reporting. By early fall, the analysts expect the car companies ""to ramp spending back up to support new model introductions and to regain market share from the imports."" Such an event, says the SG Cowen crew, could mark a significant catalyst for companies that depend heavily on TV advertising, like AOL Time Warner (AOL), Viacom (VIA, VIAB), News Corp. (NWS), and Disney (DIS). ( BS)"

Sources at OPS indicate that once OPS completes its review of line 1110 and approves it to come back online, there is no formal process to grant El Paso permission to bring the entire system back to full capacity at 1.1 bcf/d. Therefore, once the inspection/repairs are completed by El Paso, the company will seek permission from OPS to resume to full service. OPS would probably grant them approval within a matter of days. The uncertainty still lies in the time it will take to interpret pigging data and for OPS to conduct its review."

Subject:	Mid C New deals Sept 24

Phillip, here is the breakdown on new deals and option values for Sept 24.

Options:

Sold put with strike of 150 and volume of 30,800
Sold put with strike of 220 and volume of 92,400
Buy put with strike of 175 and volume of 61,600
Buy put with strike of 125 and volume of 30,800
Buy put with strike of 125 and volume of 30,800
Buy put with strike of 125 and volume of 30,800

Total new deal value $(3,552,534)

Value in exercising of deals (liquidations) $3,642,100

Net value to book = $89,566

The reason for the difference in new deal value for LT - NW between the new deal report and the DPR of approx $(2,290,630) was due to the fact that one of the swaps that was entered for the exercised options was incorrect.

Congratulations on being team leader for the video.  

Here are some ideas:

1.	A long winded VP drones on and on asking questions about an analyst that is not in his/her group while the camera flashes to other bored VP's.  It could start with sighs and rolling eyes then build to comical efforts to be put out of their misery. (gun to head or rope around neck)
2.	Include some digs at John Lavorato's quirks like always pulling up his shirt sleeves.

Just some ideas to get things started.  Obviously, the gas market is slow today.

I am going to miss the meeting with Vladi about Z6 and weather hedges.  I have been planning to be on vacation on August 1st -August 3rd and we are driving this afternoon before the kids get too cranky.

I went over the analysis with Vladi.  It still seems that the bias of the weather products towards an above normal winter and the averaging vs event nature of the weather options keep them from being an effective hedge for Z6.

See you on Monday.

2229,allen-p,"David,

For clarity, wherever you cite Section 6.2 in your response I assume you mean Section 6.3.  

Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan.  The beginning of Section 6.3 states ""Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?"".   This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution.  I disagree with your translation of ""a single sum distribution"" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount.  I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L.   In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1.  This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares.  Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value.  This is the methodology described in Section 7.1.

Tom Martin and Scott Neal share the above concerns.  Please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further.

For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.  

Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.

Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.  

      Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan."

Kirk, here are two documents I have revised, assuming a start date for the
week of August 24 for actual content work/design, not just kick off.  This
slips our delivery into the new year.  Please review and let's talk about
them the next time we meet.  I hope your meetings are going well.


List of deliverables and tentative and aggressive due dates, all to be
revised once we start.  In addition, as we move through design, many of
these deliverables will become unit based to ease our tracking of progress,
but since we don't know how many topics/expert stories... that we are
building, it is difficult to create that tracking now.

(See attached file: Deliverables Tracking 081301.xls)


Here is the revised list I mentioned as our SME goals each week, assuming a
start as stated above.
(See attached file: SME Meeting Schedule 081301.doc)

I look forward to talking with you tomorrow.  Give me a call and let me
know how things are going.

Please compare the enclosed Deed with the version of the Deed in your

that the version of the Deed you sign is the latest version.  Also enclosed
is the First Amendment.  The only change to this document from the version I
e-mailed to you a few days ago is the insertion of ""June 29, 2001"" as the
date the Title Company acknowledged receipt of AMHP's $25,000 Extension Fee.

This spreadsheet is an attempt to outline supply & demand in San Marcos by unit.  Next, I want to look at the numbers by bedroom.  Let's compare numbers.

Here is a list of questions:

1.	Unit mixes of all proposed projects.
2.	Completion date of  Blazer Development (220), Capstone (270), Melrose (202), Bonner-Carr. (186)
3.	Is the Capstone 270 units or 270 beds?


 
This spreadsheet illustrates that supply will exceed demand in 2002 but demand will catch up in 2003-2005.  San Marcos will have over 6,000 units.  If the 350 excess units in 2002 were distributed over the entire population that would push occupancy down by 5%.  That would not be a disaster.

Tomorrow, I would like to refine this spreadsheet and try to support some of the population and job growth assumptions with more current data.

Let me know what you think.

The rehearing request restates our arguments in response to the NOPR  that (1) permanent, formal reporting requirements are not appropriate to address a temporary problem and are beyond the scope of the Commission's powers under the Natural Gas Act and (2) the commission significantly underestimated the burden of the reporting requirements as well as the responding parties' ability to comply.  We also request that the reports, if they must be submitted, be due 45 days after the end of the month instead of the required 30 days.
Please provide any comments or suggestions you may have on this draft to either myself (713-853-5840) or Leslie (505-623-6778) by COB Wednesday (8/22).

JP Morgan is comparing a file of calculated daily curve shift to actual P&L.  Gas P&L for 2001 was 1.2 Billion but the theoretical curve shift was -13 million.  This is from a file assembled by David Port which is attached.  The biggest difference is 9/14 ($500 million).  This is probably money coming out of reserves.  Besides that day there are many smaller differences.  Can you help me by pulling the P&L packets from some of the larger days?  The answer might be that the file from RAC is bogus.

Good morning. My name is Nancy Turner, and I have recently joined Kristin Walsh's competitive analysis group where I follow gas industry issues. 

As you may recall, earlier this summer we informed you that El Paso's line 1110 had been brought down for repair, pigging and OPS review.  Our sources at El Paso and OPS have indicated to us this week that line 1110 is expected to come back online on September 1st.  We understand that the throughput on the entire system at that time should be at least 920 Mmcf/d (same as before it went offline). However, there is a strong possibility that OPS may grant the system permission to return to it's full capacity at 1.1 Bcf/d on September 1st.

We are trying to obtain more information on the capacity issue and hope to have this confirmed early next week.  We will keep you posted, but if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at X 51623 or Kristin at X 39510.

Phillip;

I see that you talked to Andrew this afternoon so that you have an understanding of where we are on that front.

I am still analyzing the demand/supply numbers we talked about.  I am going to be working in Austin in the morning and San Marcos in the afternoon.

I have a number of things to verify before I feel I can finish the supply/demand question accurately.  I also need to follow up on the permits and see where they are in process, I need to check on Tas review and a number of other items.

Talk to you soon.

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and are currently parking in an Enron Contract garage you are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The  Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until  Sky Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a an information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions."

Matt,
As we discussed several times previously, including earlier this week, Nine Energy Services LLC is a CREDIT WATCH COUNTERPARTY and a WMBE (Women and Minority owned Business Enterprises), which means that ALL trades need to be approved by Credit and documented with a Resale Agreement. Every time we transact, ENA's Confirmation Group needs to know from whom to expect payment, i.e. San Diego Gas & Electric. The nature of the transaction exposes ENA to secondary risk with the ultimate counterparty. On another note, some transactions COULD be declined by Credit due to direct exposure/risk that the ENA has with the Counterparty, outside of any WMBE Transactions. 

Sitara Deal Number 1014433 was another violation of Corporate Credit Policy. In the future, please contact Credit before transacting with any Credit Watch Counterparty.

Political Update

International

US Arab allies (Egypt, Saudi, Jordan, Kuwait, UAE) walking a fine line.  Masses believe US got what it deserves, but leaders have to condemn attacks to maintain relations with Washington.  Moderate Arab leaders are concerned that support for attacks at home -- and possible US reactions to strike -- will increase instability and could lead to major upheaval in their countries.  Saudi sources expect ""state of confusion"" to exist for immediate period ahead.

In the West, no intelligence or law enforcement agency has anything concrete yet. Everything is therefore speculation, albeit logical speculation. Most importantly, the sophistication means someone bigger than bin Laden was involved, even if he was the final perpetrator. 

Oil Politics

OPEC's Rodriguez has reassured oil markets on supplies, but no high-level Saudi officials have officially echoed this sentiment (nothing from Oil Minister Naimi).  Unofficially, we have reports that Saudi officials reporting that the terrorist incident ""relieves pressure on us to make anti-US moves"" in oil policy."
2284,allen-p,"Jacques,

Did you receive the fax from Kevin Kolb with a small change on page 2.  It also included the conveyance and assignment document.  Does this look ok to you? Is the language ""Transfer will occur when first lien holder, Pacific Southwest Bank, approves the assignment"" sufficient?  Hopefully it is ok.  Let me know if it is and I will come by your office to pick up executable copies.

Thank you,

Phillip;

These are just what I started with.  I have not really fully looked at each
spreadsheet for error in logic or other.

I notice the primary difference between the existing projects and new
projects is that on an existing project you have to had value to be able to
increase the cash flow to be able to finance out of them to be able to
achieve a decent IRR. Thus you have to pay as little as possible, increase
the cash flow (i.e.-renovations), to compete with the quality of new
construction.  And no I am not making numbers up nor am I sold on new
construction strictly.  I just am working on the best look as possible.

I look forward to discussing this further.

Sincerely,

Dan, I am interested.  I know that Sue Mara spoke with Ron on this subject also, although I was not on the call.  The matter was not discussed on our Western Wholesale call this morning either, since I did not become aware of it till later.  I would therefore like to receive input from Sue and others on our team about this, getting final sign off to proceed from Linda Robertson and Jim Steffes.  If we elect to proceed, it would be appropriate to bill all participating marketers in equal shares.  Thanks.  Ray

Phillip;

These are just what I started with.  I have not really fully looked at each
spreadsheet for error in logic or other.

I notice the primary difference between the existing projects and new
projects is that on an existing project you have to had value to be able to
increase the cash flow to be able to finance out of them to be able to
achieve a decent IRR. Thus you have to pay as little as possible, increase
the cash flow (i.e.-renovations), to compete with the quality of new
construction.  And no I am not making numbers up nor am I sold on new
construction strictly.  I just am working on the best look as possible.

I look forward to discussing this further.

Sincerely,



Greg Thorse

The spreadsheet below (""Valuation Summary.."") calculates the value Enron would realize if we turned back the capacity or released it at full tolls.  As of 9/17 mids, the 200,000/d leg would generate $16,918,907 if turned back.  There is still a substantial amount of value above variable costs on the books.  For 03-06, variable costs are around $0.15 but the mid-market spread is $0.45.  The PV volume for that term is 22,000 contracts.

I would modify this document slightly.  The first section is titled ""Introduction to Risk Management"" and the second section is ""Hedging Instruments/Risk Management Products"".  However, many of the bullet points in the first section are describing hedging instruments that belong in second section.  I would limit the introduction to types of risk, identifying risk, and examples when risks are not hedged.  Then the second section should contain all the details of hedging tools.  Definitions of derivatives and how they can be used to manage the risk in the first section would be in this section.  The third section would include the roles and accounting basics.  You might want to include the commodity 101 info here, at least gas and power.

Phillip,

I am trying to press Bank to get the Deed of Trust to you. I am in a balanc=
ing act between moving on the construction and holding until the lien is pe=
rfected. I talked to Cheerie and she said the person in Dallas is trying to=
 get it done today, however, she may not finish it out today, which means i=
t will be sent for Thursday morning delivery to a sister Ticor office for s=
ignature and recording.  Have they told you any of this? Or do I need to ma=
ke sure you know when, where, and how as soon as I know.

I talked to Andrew this morning the Dallas office received the Appraisal an=
d gave the information to us over the phone.  The appraised value as built =
is 12.5 million, the NOI is $1,152,695.  The problem is the Land Value is $=
1,120,000, as this is what they have recorded as the transaction cost in Ja=
nuary.  Andrew talked to me about if we want to put additional costs on top=
 of this showing improvements or other costs associated with the value to s=
how an increase in value?.  I am tending to think we are going to reduce ou=
r overall loan by adjusting the Land, Title Policy Amount, Debt Carry Cost =
and some other small adjustments to costs. This would reduce our overall de=
bt and resultant equity requirement. The main difference in committing to a=
 greater loan is that our costs of points will rise and our equity may be o=
ut of balance in the end, vs. if we borrow the exact amount, we may risk be=
ing short and needing a loan increase for any soft cost overages. I have be=
en working on this and I am reviewing the changes to see what overall effec=
ts each change will have on your equity and return.

We are firm on the construction numbers given to you previously and we have=
 had a number of additional costs which we have been able to absorb in the =
overall construction budget.  The biggest is the detention pond dredging wh=
ich has gone up in cost.  The only area left to work through is the foundat=
ion/concrete number and I am confident we will hit that one on the mark. Th=
us, overall I am comfortable with the Hard Cost numbers at this point.

I am attempting to get with Irwin and Cheerie and seeing if we can get the =
final Doc's put together. Have'nt been able to get a meeting yet.

I spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with SIP's.  I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can decide on a builder and materials.  I already have my blueprints completed.  What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP's with 8.5"" roof panels and use a metal roof.

I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that is also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of $85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within that budget.  I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built house.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of a radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to a sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.  That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional costs for the panels.  But would the foam insulation be as effective?   Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help me construct the best home for the money.  I am trying to get a bid from Wink with Premier based on you reference.

and explanations are below. Could you respond back by EOD Monday in hopes
for us to send these outlines for Final Signoff?

Lastly, I was wondering if I could stop by (your's or Ina's desk) and pick
up your comments about the last three topic outlines by EOD Monday. Can you
let me know if this is possible?

Organizational Structure.
You  jotted down ""Jeff Gosset, M to M, P&L, and Positions"". We have an
entire section about Mark to Market in the Risk Management Inputs topic.
P&L statements and Position reports are large sections in the Accounting
and Reporting topic. In addition, we discuss Mid Office in the Overview
page of this topic (org. structure). Is this enough or were you thinking
something in addition to what I just mentioned.
(See attached file: Framework Org Structure_4.doc)

Accounting and Reporting
I've incorporated the areas of  ""G&L, cash payments, and reconcilation into
the last section of the outline. Is this what you were thinking?

Phillip:

The target for end of October is 1283. We're not sure what's driving the day to day variation. Direct effects of recent precipitation, combined with some very big precip forecast errors, are part of the explanation, but there also appears to be something going on with management of the non-treaty storage that BPA's cached upstream in Arrow. We've been looking into that, and hope to get some news via Technical Management Team today.

From a multi-purpose project manager's perspective, I think that current reservoir elevation is one or two feet too high, so I do expect drawdown by month end. I also suspect that there are some limits in the non-treaty storage approaching that require at least partial withdrawal.

The net effect should be a rise in production-- no more downstream storage is available and upstream releases will increase, certainly by November 1, but probably earlier.

The elevation is starting to creep lower.

Can you help us with these questions?  Will this drafting to continue?  What is the elevation target for the end of the month?  Why did yesterday's inflow decline so much?

Thank you,

Regarding contracts, the Texas Real Estate Commission website has copies of the contracts we need.  The website is below.

Jeff:

I talked to your dad and he has mentioned that you might be interested in 
having our class build a shed for you.  We pretty much make whatever you 
would like to the specifications that you prefer. All of our buildings are 
durable and solidly constructed.  We build them in our shop and the ownner 
is rersponsible for their delivery.  There is no labor cost so you are only 
charged for the materials.

Our most popular size and style is the 8' x 12' barn . This is the most 
economical building that we construct and it is an easier one to haul to a 
given site. This building has an exterior of T-111 siding which is cedar 
style grooved exterior plywood which can be stained and sealed. We have 
usually build them with a 3'-10 1/2"" wide door opening.  I would think that 
would be wide enough for a four wheeler, but you would have to have your 
dad measure your vehicle to make sure.. We have probably built and sold 
over 30 of these in the past ten years. The price on this shed usually 
varies between $800 and $900.



Your dad also indicated an interest in a 10 x 12 gable style shed which is 
a bit bigger and ofcourse more expensive.  It has vinyl siding and aluminum 
soffit/overhang, I am attaching a picture of one we made for Joe 
Pronschinske.  This project is a bit harder to transport as it is oversize 
and legally you are  to obtain an oversize laod permit to haul it.   Your 
dad indicated that Joe would possibly haul it though.
The picture I am attaching shows a common 3' entry door.  We are presently 
building a structure for Nolan Goplin that has a overhead 6' wide roll up 
door.  The price on a 10' x 12' shed with a 6' wide roll-up door would be 
roughly $1500.


We will build either style and can modify the plans to meet your 
needs.  With the time we have left in the semester the 8 x 12 would be the 
easiest for us to build, but if you let me know right away, by Monday 
October 22, that you would like a 10 x12 size we would still be able to 
finish that one on time.

If you have any questions just e-mail me or call:
	Whitehall School Disctrict 715-538-4364

Greetings Phillip,

I received your phone message.  Thanks for the update.  I have been talking
with contractors and Spring Valley.  At this point we are trying to
determine whether the addition over the garage would be workable.  Heather
probably told you that I am meeting with a contractor on 11/7 at your home
to get a firm bid on the project.  I spoke today with the Spring Valley
building consultant and faxed him some detail.  There are a couple of
possible problems he is looking at and we'll possibly need to get a variance
from the decision makers when the time comes.

In the meantime, I printed out the earnest money contract and sellers
disclosure forms from the website you found.  We are waiting on the final
word from Spring Valley to move ahead.  I'll let you know when we have some
new information.

Thanks,

The Social Security and Medicare tax has been previously withheld on your deferral.  You would be subject to only Federal Income Tax withholding on the distribution.

Subject:	Topic Framework Updates!


Hi Kirk,

Here are the answers to some of your questions and concerns on the Topic
Frameworks.  These updates, along with discussions with SMEs, took a total
of one hour.

Accounting and Reporting - (1) Deal Flow - <<According to Berney Aucoin>>
there is no difference between an Orginator/Marketer  on the deal flow,
they stated that a deal is a deal and it is the same for everyone.  (2)
Roles associated within the Desk - <<According to Berney Aucoin >> Admin
support and Commerical support should not be added.  We are concentrating
on the major roles within a desk, any more granular could be inaccurate
because it is different for every company.  Admin support - answers the
phones and Commerical support runs the books in the back office.

Commodity Fundamentals - (1) Broker fees and Margin calls were added in the
overview, <<According to Berney Aucoin>> it was worth mentioning, but
wholesale is exempt from fees and taxes.  (2) Industrial, Retail and
Wholesale was added as an i.e., by consumption by consumer

Organizational Structure - (1) Communication - Inter/Intra department
communications were added into the Challenges of Managing Trading Function
and Trading System. Inter department communication (i.e., between
departments within organization) and Intra department communications (i.e.,
between roles on a desk after a trade/deal) (between desks, internal
communication between Marketer, Originator, Structurer and Trader, after a
trade and reconciling position reports)

Risk Management Inputs - Consequences within VaR guidelines was added to
""Trading outside of prescribed VaR guidelines

Swaps - Types of credit classifications was added to Credit Review under
Protecting Againist Loss.

The note for the references used was included on every topic framework -

Here are my comments:

Section 9b-  It is my understanding that the Utility lines are currently under construction and should be finished by late February 2002.  Can we reference the work that is being performed by the contractor, JC Evans.  I want to avoid any ambiguity regarding the ""Utility Lines"".  Also can we make the same distinction in the Utility Construction Escrow Agreement in Section C.

 Section 10-  Please change to Purchaser can extend closing for 3 successive periods of 30 days each for $10,000 per extension, not applicable to purchase price and non-refundable.

Also, I would prefer to sign the first amendment and the utility escrow documents at the same time since they reference each other.

We pay ""0"" going forward
We have already played 300K in 3Q2001
Outstanding bill for $27,740 will hit Enron Q1, 2002

Enron and surviving entity will have the right to use it internally

We value Enrons SME time @ around 300K

Accenture will have the right to use it internally and modify the product at its will for internal & external use.

This arrangement will void 900K Enrons Revenue from Accenture

Enron would receive 0% royalty on all external sales.  I was thinking to stay away from royalty as we do not know what will be new company position on this matter. Also,  I do not think Accenture will want to enter into partnership structure with a ghost company unless we get Dinergy involved.

***********************************************************************

If we do not reach the agreement: 1. Terminate and pay around 500-600k (estimate)  The payment could be deferred in to 2Q 2002 or
				 2. Continue ""as is"" with payment differed for 90 days or merger.

We are sending Accenture official notice as of tomorrow we have 10 business days to workout solution or terminate.

Phillip,

I am following up to our BRM conversation from Friday.  Obviously it is a valid questions to ask and as you requested I am attaching two documents: one summarizing the options and  2nd cash flow impact.  In the cash flow impact Case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost.  (it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cut in sim exercises 50K)  The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you. A total of two sims could be cut one.  Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting.  Also,  I will ask them to cut the meeting by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions.  I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around. 

Obviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time.  We will continue to review how to cut labor and expenses.
One question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is as follow.  Is BRM ""core"" to the Enron for next few months or new organization?  Please consider the costs of finishing this project.


Sincerely,

Michelle,

Here are my comments:

Section 9b-  It is my understanding that the Utility lines are currently under construction and should be finished by late February 2002.  Can we reference the work that is being performed by the contractor, JC Evans.  I want to avoid any ambiguity regarding the ""Utility Lines"".  Also can we make the same distinction in the Utility Construction Escrow Agreement in Section C.

 Section 10-  Please change to Purchaser can extend closing for 3 successive periods of 30 days each for $10,000 per extension, not applicable to purchase price and non-refundable.

Also, I would prefer to sign the first amendment and the utility escrow documents at the same time since they reference each other.

I have sent Mike B. a copy of this email.

Thank you,

Phillip

I need to get the contract for Galaxy and Grande executed today. In addition
I will need to close the loan at the title company in Hays County this week.
If you elect me vice-president of Bishops Corner, Inc., I can take care of
all of the documents.  From a logistics standpoint this probably would be
the best way to handle it.

Please let me know today if possible so I can send them to the lender.

2349,allen-p,"Greg,

I plugged the data on Colonial Oaks into your format.  The actual NOI for 2001 is around 305,000.  But there is not a professional management company.  Subtracting $25,000 for management costs the NOI would be $280,000.  However, I increased the taxes and a few other expenses to bring total expenses up to $3,000/unit.  This would yield an NOI of $240,000.  Comparing the rents charged to the other 17 properties, it doesn't look like the rents have a great deal of upside.  

The asking price is $2,700,000.  Using $240,000 would make this an 8.9 cap.  Using the seller's NOI of $280,000 would be a 10.4 cap.  The cost per unit is $33,750 for a 1969 project.  The cost per square foot is 36.58.  

The numbers would be better if the property was offered at $2.5 million.  Jeff Smith claims that $2.7 million is as low as the seller will go.  This property has not been on the market.  So I would like your input of what the market would pay for it.  If $280,000 is a reasonable NOI, then I would thing it would be sold fairly quickly for $2.7 million.  It does have the benefit of all brick exterior and elderly tenants.  Plus the location is by far the most convenient.

Financing is the other consideration.  I am assuming 25 year, 7%,  and 25% down.  What do you think could actually be achieved?  Can you put me in contact with a lender?

I will follow up with a phone call.

Thanks,

Phillip"
2350,allen-p,"Jeff,

I reviewed your revised offer sheet.  I am OK with the effective income of $484K.  Her records show basically no other income ($75/month), so I subtracted $3,000 from your number.  The expenses just need to reflect $20,000 more property taxes and the numbers should be right on.  $484 less $244 would be $240 of NOI.  I spoke to Jim Murnane this afternoon.  He feels this property would most likely warrant 7.5% and a 30 year amortization.  See the attached spreadsheets."
2351,allen-p,"Here is lakeside in your format.  Looks like 11% cash on cash plus whatever principal is paid on the note.  My biggest concern is that actual vacancies and concessions have been higher than in the pro forma used to underwrite the offering.  Also expenses were higher.  Why would we be able to do any better than the existing management?

 

I would like to come see it again on Wednesday.  I would be bringing 1 or 2 others.  Could we see it in the morning around 9:30 or 10 am?

I don't know what your need for brokerage services are, but Scott is nice enough as far as brokers go.  Personally, I am extremely pleased with the transition to online platforms and find that I can get 90%+ of my business done online.  If you have a need for brokers, Scott is a good choice.

Hi guys,

We met last February when I was over in Houston and you kindly gave me some pointers as to how we in the UK can apply your experiences to the UK market.

I have had a call from Scott at Amerex saying he is moving to London to set up here.
He has said you would recommend him with a view to working our numbers here in Europe.

Would you be able to comment favourably or otherwise when you get a minute?

I checked with Wink and his prices were slightly lower per square foot but the builder was not keen on the panels Wink is selling because the dimensional lumber to frame windows and doors is not included.  So that reduces some of the savings.  Either way it still appears that a panel home will cost close to $20,000 more for a 4000 sq ft home.  Even if I assume my energy savings will be $125/month, it would take approximately 22 years to recover the upfront cost assuming a 5% interest rate.  

Cost is a major concern, but I am also concerned with the comfort level of the upstairs.  I am under the impression that the panels will prevent the upstairs from feeling significantly hotter than the downstairs as most two story homes do.  What are some other alternatives that would also be effective?  Radiant barrier?  More attic ventilation?  

Thank you for your help.

Phillip, there are a number of alternative systems that will allow the same
level of energy efficiency. I would wait a bit for Wink's bid though. You
say that your panel costs are $20,000 additional. that sounds like a lot. I
just did a panel house with a 2100 sq ft footprint and the total panel cost
was about $25,000 with 8 inch walls and 10 inch roof. Stay in touch and we
can discuss alternatives if that becomes necessary. If your budget is $85-90
per sq. ft.  excluding land costs your costs will be on the low end of the
true custom home level but should be achievable with good management.

Richard,

I spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with
SIP's.  I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can
decide on a builder and materials.  I already have my blueprints
completed.  What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP's with
8.5"" roof panels and use a metal roof.

I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that
is also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of
$85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within
that budget.  I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built
house.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of a
radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same
energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to
a sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.
That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional
costs for the panels.  But would the foam insulation be as effective?
Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help
me construct the best home for the money.  I am trying to get a bid from
Wink with Premier based on you reference.

Thank you for your help.

I had a couple of questions about the exchange.

1.	Can I place the replacement property into a limited partnership?
2.	The cash to be escrowed is approx. $650K.  At money market rates of 3.5% the interest in six months would be over $10K.  Will the funds be held in an interest bearing account and will I receive the interest?
3.	Should I fed ex all these documents to the title company?

Phillip,

It is looking like we will have to apply for a variance due to a set back
requirement when building over 10 feet tall.  Normal set back is 10 feet.
For every 3 ft higher you go, another 5 feet is added to the set back.  The
garage would be about 20 ft so we'd normally need to be back about 25 ft.
Currently, it's 13 feet.

I'm going to look into what's involved in getting on the agenda for a
variance.  I'll let you know what I find out.

Thanks,

This section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out in the year following the termination event.  The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent.  As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent.  We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares).  If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares.  Please let me know you preference.

As you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt.  As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files.  He has become our department expert on the PSA account (much more knowledgeable than myself)  and the various plan provision amendments.  If you would like, we can set up a conference call with you, myself, and Larry to go over the payment methodology.  Please let me know a date and time that is convenient for you.

Phillip,

The purpose of this e-mail is to explain the results of our discussions
with the technical team after our meeting with you. We need to get your
approval of the points listed below so that we can begin building the
application.

We can have the Position and P&L Reports show the results of the learner's
decisions in previous periods, which will allow the learner move forward in
time with wrong answers. This will achieve our goal of giving the learners
""more rope"" and letting them see the results of their mistakes. In order to
achieve this, we will have the following constraints:
   The feedback will be fairly high-level, as we discussed in Thursday's
   meeting. We will be able to provide feedback on cumulative P&L and
   positions, but not about specific actions the learner took in a previous
   period. We will not, for example, be able to say things like ""In
   November, when we were headed into a cold winter, you chose to withdraw
   gas. What you should have done was...""
   We cannot save the P&L and position numbers. This means that if the
   learner leaves the simulation, returns to the main menu, or experiences
   a computer crash, his decisions will not be saved and he will need to
   start over at time period one.
   We cannot have the learner calculate P&L on storage costs,
   transportation costs, or hedging instruments. This is because the right
   answer and the available answer choices would have to depend on the
   decisions the learner has made. Now that the learner can go down any
   path he chooses, the number of possible answers is extremely large, and
   the right answers are variable. I believe these tasks will be actually
   better if we don't have the learner calculate P&L because he has already
   calculated P&L numerous times in the structurer/customer scenarios and
   conversion and arbitrage scenarios. Furthermore, the type of feedback we
   would have to give about specific P&L numbers will not flow well with
   the high-level, global-type feedback we are now planning to give in this
   task.

We cannot export price numbers into Excel because the Indeliq framework
does not support the downloading of data into external applications. The
technical effort required to add this functionality far exceeds our current
development budget. We can, however, do some calculations for the learner
on the screen. We can also try to somehow allow the learner to make the
mistake of using future prices instead of discounted prices.

If you could please respond with your approval or concerns by end of day
Wednesday, it will allow us to move forward with the development of this
simulation. I would be happy to discuss these points with you; please let
me know if you would like to set up a meeting.

Thank you.

I received your email on the Killeen post office.  I am still having a tough time making the math work.  Can you prepare a spreadsheet that would show why the post office is such a good investment?  Maybe the assumptions I am making about interest rates, expenses, or value at the end of the lease are incorrect.

Phillip,

Hope your trip to Kerrville was worthwhile, and you had a chance to
check out the Heritage Building.

I am writing to tell you about another post office that has just come
back on the market...it's in Killeen, and was under contract for about
30 days. But one of my clients here who was in a 1031 exchange, and had
designated three post offices with us, could only actually buy two, so
today he released this one.

The Killeen post office (Harker Heights, a suburb) is one of the best we
have had in our inventory. It was built by a developer who is a friend
of ours and has been constructing POs for many years. She had to turn
down two other potential buyers recently because it was under contract.

I'm sure it will not last long. I have attached a flyer for you, and can
supply a copy of the lease too. If you are interested, do let me know
soon...we will need to act quickly! With best regards, Jim Wills

The application for the variance states that I applied for a permit on October 29th and was rejected.  Do the discussions with the building inspector constitute denial.

Phillip,

Right now you can use the entire amount in your money market ( approx.
$785,000) for your muni bond portfolio.  After the treasury comes due on Jan
31, 2002, you will have another $750,000.  You really don't have to worry
about your margin requirements because you still get  80% of the value of
your municipals credited  towards marginable securities.  So, the bottom
line is 785m right now.  Jan 31, 2002 another 750m.  One thing to keep in
mind are 28 put contracts you still have out there.  Unless you close that
position you will probably get put those.

Let me know how much you want for your Muni Proposal to be for.  Also, if
there are any specifics that you want me to consider with your proposal such
as duration, maturity, etc.

I turned in the application for a variance yesterday.  The hearing will be =
on January 8th.  In order to get on the calendar for the Dec 4th hearing, t=
he application had to be in by November 9th.  I was under the impression th=
at yesterday was the deadline.  Sorry if I dropped the ball. =20

On another note, I spoke to Joe Edwards yesterday and he had some useful su=
ggestions about the addition.   It might be possible to move the addition f=
orward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the new space.=
  You could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and use the new =
space for your game/play/music room.  Then you could close off the existing=
 play room to replace the bedroom lost.  Part of the play room that is bord=
ered by the stair rail and looks down to the living room could be used for =
a built in desk with a couple of computers.  This way you would not have to=
 add a second staircase.  The walls needed to convert the playroom to a bed=
room should be minor construction.  In the back you could slope the roof un=
til you were within the setback.  Then you could place a large dormer facin=
g the back of the property or bring a wall straight up.  From the driveway =
the addition would have the same elevation as your drawing but intwould be =
brought forward with a covered parking area below the addition.  The kitche=
n and dining room windows would still open to the driveway but they would b=
e more shaded.  That is the west side of the house so that might not be a b=
ad thing.  Your ideas about opening up the kitchen to the living room or di=
ning room would still be possible.  Personally, I think opening the dining =
room would be the better idea.

I don't know if you can visualize this or if you are even interested in exp=
loring anything except your original plan.  But I wanted to suggest somethi=
ng in case the variance was not granted.  Let me know if you want me to try=
 and sketch out these ideas.

Greg,

After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de=
ferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg=
arding the Phantom Stock Account. =20

Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis=
tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe=
nalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =
of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=
s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=
ceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=
 of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=
 of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=
rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=
s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=
ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=
res in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=
n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=
at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=
f Enron Corp. common stock.

There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=
  section 6.3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=
""  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=
ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=
t apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating ""a single sum distrib=
ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one pay=
ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.

The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =
is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=
he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states ""The val=
ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=
g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=
ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock"".=
  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=
 share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =
beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=
p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=
ction 6.3.

The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=

Phillip,

We spoke with Ina and scheduled a meeting with you for this Thursday from
10:00 - 11:00 in Room 3267 of the Enron Building.

The purpose of this meeting will be to get your sign-off on the feedback
approach for the simulation. We have outlined, in greater detail than you
and I have previously discussed, what we will provide feedback on and how
we will provide it for each scenario. It will be important for us to get
your input on Thursday because we need to finalize the feedback structure
before we can begin building the course.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at Ext. 5-6676.

Subject:	Re: new PO available

Phillip, Carlos and I will try to respond to your request for a spreadsheet in the next day or two (I'll be at the home office in New Braunfels tomorrow). Meanwhile, I wanted to pass on some news...the Killeen post office probably is gone...I wrote a contract this morning that's now on its way to California for signature. Of course, if you wanted to submit one also, we can do it fairly quickly.

Incidentally, I had the price wrong on Killeen...it's $1,377,550, not $1,360,000.

HOWEVER!! Here's info about another new listing that may be ideal for you; it's a brand new post office at CANYON LAKE, just north of SA, and in a really ideal location to serve all the small communities that surround the reservoir. I have attached a flyer for you...this one, like Killeen, will not be around long because there are other brokers promoting it. I have talked to the postmaster, who tells me that almost all the boxes are gone, and the building is just now ready for occupancy. CPS is connecting over 2200 new power boxes a month in the area. It's really growing. Let me know what you think!!

With best regards, Jim Wills

Greg,

After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de=
ferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg=
arding the Phantom Stock Account. =20

Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis=
tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe=
nalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =
of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=
s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=
ceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=
 of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=
 of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=
rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=
s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=
ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=
res in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=
n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=
at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=
f Enron Corp. common stock.

There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=
  section 6.3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=
""  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=
ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=
t apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating ""a single sum distrib=
ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one pay=
ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.

The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =
is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=
he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states ""The val=
ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=
g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=
ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock"".=
  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=
 share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =
beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=
p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=
ction 6.3.

The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=
 distribution under each of the three interpretations:

Importance:	High

Phillip,

I am following up to our BRM conversation from Friday.  Obviously it is a valid questions to ask and as you requested I am attaching two documents: one summarizing the options and  2nd cash flow impact.  In the cash flow impact Case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost.  (it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cut in sim exercises 50K)  The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you. A total of two sims could be cut one.  Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting.  Also,  I will ask them to cut the meeting by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions.  I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around. 

Obviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time.  We will continue to review how to cut labor and expenses.
One question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is as follow.  Is BRM ""core"" to the Enron for next few months or new organization?  Please consider the costs of finishing this project.


Sincerely,

Rather than fill in the design selections, I have attached a spreadsheet that estimates the costs.  Since I have spent so much time researching the house, I think my numbers are pretty close.  

I would be interested in working with a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee basis.  I don't know if this would be agreeable to you.  Take a look at the numbers and let me know what you think.  If we could work together on this basis, I will complete the design selections.  I will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors.

We are torn between two good locations.  However, we are leaning towards Kerrville.  The lot in Kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in San Marcos, so we are really stretched to make this house work financially.  We have decided that if we can make Kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead, if not we will fall back to  our plan to move to San Marcos.  

I don't know how many jobs you have going currently, but if we could reach an agreement we would like to start immediately.

Phillip,

Thank you for meeting with us today. I want to take a few minutes to
summarize the decisions that came out of our meeting.

1. Feedback Approach: We will incorporate the ideas and suggestions you
gave us and move forward with this approach.

2. SME Review of Knowledge System Topics: When the time comes for Topics
reviews, we will send you the name of the SME who is responsible for
sign-off on each topic.

3. Conversion and Arbitrage Problems: We will brainstorm ways to
incorporate more problems without going over our 4-6 hour target. We will
meet with you next Tuesday at 10:00 to review the problems as we've
designed them so far and arrive at a solution. (I will send an e-mail
Monday with the room number.)

Have a good weekend.

Your spreadsheet shows the same type of return I was calculating.  Your insurance and repair numbers seem very low.   Also, assuming that the options to extend at higher rates will be exercised is a huge leap of faith.  I don't believe these properties cost any where near the $150+/sf that they are being offered at.  

Based on the optimistic back loaded returns, I would not be comfortable purchasing a post office at this time.  Thank you anyway.

Phillip,

Hope you are doing well this week, and have great plans for Turkeyday!!
We'll be with family in Austin, and kind of on a maiden voyage in our
'83 Avion that we're upgrading for camping!

Here's a look at three post offices in a slightly different manner.
Remember that the Roma one is about 5 years old, was a 15 yr lease
originally. The other two are new.

The Roma is like buying a savings account. It would be paid off in 10
years, you would reap some cash flow during that period, then the bonus
kicks in after that with the 10 yr. renewals at a higher lease income
after it's paid off. It would probably go beyond another 10 years. Cash
on cash returns don't mean as much on shorter amoritazations like Roma.

We have shown this info and flyers to several people, so do let us know
if you are interested in any of them...I really don't think they will
last long. With best regards, Jim Wills

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack=
 of Support
Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the=
 bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a=
 deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republic=
ans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic cauc=
us is reportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republic=
ans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, o=
nce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double=
 dip"" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg=
islature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses th=
e details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take plac=
e.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the lon=
g-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require t=
hat the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in =
breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th=
e bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st wi=
ll be very difficult.

The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat=
e would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General=
 Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately =
$8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this =
concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for ful=
l disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the =
details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they=
 will support the bond issuance to go forward.

Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB =
31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bi=
ll passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac=
k of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs fo=
r community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be am=
ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, curre=
ntly in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should get =
paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be li=
kely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).=20
=20
According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republic=
ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in =
the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 =
of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republ=
icans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend=
 to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers repo=
rtedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind=
ications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.

Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time
The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create t=
he California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion=
 authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be aut=
horized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the addi=
tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power =
going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authoriz=
ations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor =
has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is =
that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No f=
urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it =
is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas=
ing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the Calif=
ornia Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be consi=
dered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earl=
ier in the crisis.
=20
SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy
At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  T=
he first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the =
governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au=
gust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According t=
o sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has s=
igned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi=
s and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicat=
es that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank=
ruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. =20

The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond is=
suance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) s=
tating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, th=
en the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the st=
ate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and p=
assed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for=
 bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and=
 the DWR proportionately from rate payments."

Phillip,

This section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out in the year following the termination event.  The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent.  As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent.  We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares).  If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares.  Please let me know you preference.

As you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt.  As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files.  He has become our department expert on the PSA account (much more knowledgeable than myself)  and the various plan provision amendments.  If you would like, we can set up a conference call with you, myself, and Larry to go over the payment methodology.  Please let me know a date and time that is convenient for you.

Thanks,

Renee

Renee,

Thank you for digging in to the issue of Deferred Phantom Stock Units.  It is clear that the payment will be made in shares.  However, I still don't understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares.  The plan document under VII.  Amount of Benefit Payments reads ""The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock.""  Can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers on my account.

Thank you,

2404,allen-p,"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  

My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time."

Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.

On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some additional insight?

Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.  I believe he has sent you my plans.  They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.  

Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from the distributor?  If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you please email them to me as well?

Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.

Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.

I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email with comments.

Subject:	Re: This morning's Commission meeting delayed   

Phil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed doors ""in smoke filled rooms"", if not directly between Commissioners then among FERC staffers.  Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:

Price caps are almost never the right answer
Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages
Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer
Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable
Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the West

This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.  Ray

Here is a photograph of a similar house.  The dimensions would be 56'Wide X 41' Deep for the living area.  In addition there will be a 6' deep two story porch across the entire back and 30' across the front.  A modification to the front will be the addition of a gable across 25' on the left side.  The living area will be brought forward under this gable to be flush with the front porch.

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.

Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.  However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.

I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in cost over stick built.

I received the fax from Velasquez Masonry for $11,000.  He is proposing to do work on nine buildings.  From the memo from the city it sounds like 33,34,35, and 42 are the units that are at risk for collapse.  I don't want to pay for any discretionary work.  Also, I am still waiting for a quote from another mason.  

I am willing to offer $5,000 toward the repair and removal of rock in return for the release prepared by Jacques.  With regard to the utilities I want to have them transferred on Monday the 21st.  That will be one month that the utilities have been in my name.  It needs to be clear that I will net that month's electric and water against the $5,000 for the rock.

If she is willing to take the money for repairs we should be able to wrap things up immediately.  If not we will have to continue negotiations, but the utilities still need to be transferred.

Not included is the rumored 400 MW-mo of federal lower Columbia spill that's been considered for the May to mid-June time frame."

I would like to have a 2 hour team building session for the assistants, receptionists, and clerks on Friday 5/25/01.  The only thing that will be charged to your cost center is the cost of a lunch brought in for the administrative staff.  

I know that the assistants usually are out of here between 12:30 to 1:30 being that this is a Friday before a holiday.   I would like to have the session start at 12:30 so that they can still be out of here by 2:30 that day.  This would require the phones being on solo pilot starting at 12:30.

Please respond with your approval, questions and/or comments as soon as time permits so I can set everything up this week.

Many thanks,
Ina Rangel"

I read through the data request.  We cannot provide several of the items that they requested.  We do not break out our california deals into separate transport and commodity components.  Also the majortiy of our buys and sells net out without exchanging actual transport contract numbers.  I know in the past Becky C. has worked with our back office to pull the data directly from the system.  Let me know if I need to do anything to assist gathering the data.  I would  like to review the final product before it is submitted.

Subject:	California Update 5/22/01

PLEASE TREAT AS CONFIDENTIAL

A source had a meeting today with California state treasurer Phil Angelides.  Here are the main points from their conversation

1.	Anglelides Certain that SoCal Will Go Bankrupt

Corroborating our line over the past four months, Anglelides stated with confidence that SoCal would go bankrupt and that ""he was surprised they hadn't already.""  He noted that the only reason they haven't yet is that ""they were too stupid to ring-fence the parent"" and that ""their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it.""

He added that the Davis/SoCal MOU is dead and that all the ""Plan B's"" are ""speculative"" at best.  He also thought that SoCal was being ""naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court.""

2.	Bond Issuance- $12B Not Enough

Angelides conceded that a $12B bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $18-24B.   The only reason they didn't issue more is that Angelides felt that ""$12B was all the market could handle.""  The current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $400/MWh, which Angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from State Comptroller's Kathleen Connell's office.

3.	New Generator Construction

Anglelides was explicit that the California Public Power Authority (authorized by the legislature last week) will ""build plants and not stop until we [California] has a 10-15% capacity cushion above expected demand.  Angelides expects the state to be ""5-10% short on power all summer."""

2454,allen-p,"Adrianne,

Last night I spoke to two potential candidates for the trading track, Emil Carlsson and Thomas Considine.

Emil is currently tutoring at Hofstra after leaving an option trading position.  I would recommend bringing Emil to Houston for further interviews based on his technical knowledge.  The biggest drawback was his current situation might show a lack of motivation.

Thomas was working as an equity market maker.  He is interested in making a change to a job where he can develop more expertise.  He is seeking to develop a better understanding of the market he trades.  The trading track would be an excellent match for his desires.  I would also recommend bringing Thomas to Houston for further consideration.

Managing VAR limits is essential and P&L Penalties are a great way to achieve this.  However, we need to find a way to impliment this method while minimizing negative side effects such as: (1) discouraging aggressive trading; and (2) significant morale reductions caused by penalties which do not fit the crime.

I still disagree with the $1 Million fine for such a minor violation of our VAR limit.  The punishment does not fit the crime. What message are you trying to send?  The message being received is that we should trade less aggressively and leave several million dollars of headroom at all times.  Also locations such as Socal, Malin and PG&E should be avoided due to limited liquidity and potential volatility spikes.  I know these are not your intended messages.  

I realize you have given the west desk significant leeway in the last few months regarding VAR.  We have been making excellent progress towards VAR reduction in an environment in which the VAR calculation and tolerance are constantly changing.   My suggestion for implementing a VAR control system that provides for penalties but gives traders room to probe for maximum VAR utilization is a warning for minor breaches (<$500,000) and penalties for violation of two or more consecutive days or initial violations greater than $500,000.  The amount of the penalties should be documented in advance and should increase with the amount of the violation.

Please consider these suggestions.  We want to play by the rules, but the rules need to be fair and known in advance.  Also, we are willing to accept these policy revisions retroactively and forget about the $1 million from this morning.

With regard to Socal's comments, do you have any additional information?  This is quite a 180 from the presentations that Socal has been giving to the CPUC and at other forums.  Until now they have been consistently stating that they will have plenty of gas.

Just heard this on an IEP call and wanted to pass it along.


SoCal gas has announced that it may have to curtail gas to power plants this summer.  SoCal Gas says it has to put gas in storage for winter and may not be able to do that and serve the power plants. Apparently, SoCal is shipping gas to Mexico at the same time. That will not look good to CA politicians.

The release that Jacques prepared provides for the payback of any utilities that I have been paying since 4/20.  You might mention to them that we need to get the utilities settled up before we pay the $11,000.  It might be a good idea to go ahead and have the utilities transferred so we can get the final amount since 4/20.

Also May 20th was supposed to be the 1st payment on the two notes.  But I have not received payment on either.

Let's try and wrap this up this week.

Jeff - The Pew Center is sponsoring a  2-day workshop in conjunction with an annual summer program held by  the Energy Modeling Forum in Snowmass, CO.  We are hoping to  supplement EMF's list of economists and economic modelers who are  largely academics or with government labs or offices with folks from companies  who can help shed some light on how companies anticipate markets  will react to climate policies and the possible changes to prices and  availability of cleaner fuels such as natural gas.  A description of the  2-day program follows, and we can provide more information on the EMF meeting as  well if that's helpful.  I would be grateful if you can help identify  someone at Enron -- or otherwise -- who you feel could both contribute  to and benefit from the discussions with top economists and modelers.    If you need more information, please feel  free to call me or Leianne Clements (our economist) at the Pew Center number  listed below.  
 
Thanks for considering,
Vicki Arroyo Cochran
Director of Policy Analysis



   

The Economics of Natural Gas in the Climate Change  Debate (August 9-10, 2001)

Determining future demands and supply of natural gas (NG)  are important in determining climate policies since burning NG is relatively  ""cleaner"" than burning coal and oil.   A climate policy based on reducing the carbon content in fuels would  favor NG, along with other less-carbon intensive energy sources, thus  accelerating its demand.    However, economic models looking at the climate change issue show mixed  results on this issue; many models show the demand for NG increasing relative to  more ""dirty"" fuels while others show its demand decreasing at a rate faster than  oil (explained by NG demand being more responsive to a tax).  

The Pew Center has found that NG information is often  extrapolated from that of oil.   Without clear information on the true path of the NG sector,  policy-makers will be misinformed on how to address the climate change  problem.  The Pew Center will host a  conference in conjunction with the Energy Modeling Forum of Stanford University,  to gather leading experts on both the modeling and practical side of determining  natural gas issues.  A report will  be published summarizing the topics discussed in the  conference.

 Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development 
opportunities.

 I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were 
built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for 
 around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated 
that he had more units under construction that would be 
 available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different 
from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor
 plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.  

 As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.  

 Call or email with your thoughts.

Do not underestimate the effects of the Internet economy on load growth.  I 
have been preaching the tremendous growth described below for the last year.  
The utility infrastructure simply cannot handle these loads at the 
distribution level and ultimatley distributed generation will be required for 
power quality reasons.

The City of Austin, TX has experienced 300+ MW of load growth this year due 
to server farms and technology companies.  There is a 100 MW server farm 
trying to hook up to HL&P as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 months 
due to distribution infrastructure issues.  Obviously, Seattle, Porltand, 
Boise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rude 
awakening in the next 2-3 years.

Internet Data Gain Is a Major Power Drain on
                  Local Utilities 

                  ( September 05, 2000 ) 


                  In 1997, a little-known Silicon Valley company called Exodus
                  Communications opened a 15,000-square-foot data center in 
Tukwila. 

                       The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and 
computer servers for the
                  region's growing number of dot-coms. 

                       Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up 
construction
                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than 
a mile from its
                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several 
fiber optic backbones, the
                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and 
eventually
                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, 
Microsoft and Onvia.com. 

                       Exodus is not the only company building massive data 
centers near Seattle.
                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, 
Globix and
                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house 
the networking
                  equipment of the Internet economy. 

                       It is a big business that could have an effect on 
everything from your
                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access 
your favorite Web sites.

                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and 
server farms, are
                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent 
Valley that some
                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and 
Puget Sound
                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, 
high-security
                  facilities. 

                       ""We are talking to about half a dozen customers that 
are requesting 445
                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,"" 
said Karl
                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound 
Energy. ""That is
                  the equivalent of six oil refineries."" 

                       A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, 
the rise of the Internet
                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their 
heads. 

                       Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington 
Utilities and
                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new 
data centers. The
                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing 
residential and business
                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations 
necessary to support
                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 
million each,
                  Karzmar said. 

                       Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to 
bring up the data center
                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. 

                       For the utilities that provide power to homes, 
businesses and schools in the
                  region, this is a new and complex issue. 

                       On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing 
appetite for power --
                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The 
facilities run 24 hours a
                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a 
constant revenue
                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that 
they could
                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital 
expenditures. 

                       Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will 
mean for power rates
                  in the area is still open to debate. 

                       ""These facilities are what we call extremely dense 
loads,"" said Bob Royer,
                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle 
City Light. 

                       ""The entire University of Washington, from stadium 
lights at the football
                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. 
We have data
                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 
and 50 megawatts."" 

                       With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate 
complex in Tukwila is
                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased 
the 1.35 million
                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from 
Boeing Space &
                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 
92 percent of the
                  six-building complex to seven different co-location 
companies. 

                       ""It is probably the largest data center park in the 
country,"" boasts Laurent
                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG 
Communications,
                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama 
Networks all
                  lease space in the office park. 

                       After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, 
Sabey has become an
                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under 
management or
                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole 
claims his firm is
                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in 
the country. 

                       As more people access the Internet and conduct 
bandwidth-heavy tasks
                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for 
co-location space in
                  Seattle continues to escalate. 

                       But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center 
space is growing at a
                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, 
causing similar
                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and 
California. 

                       Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location 
space, plans to nearly
                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. 
While companies
                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many 
high-tech companies
                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such 
as Exodus that
                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic 
management. 

                       ""We have 2 million square feet of space under 
construction and we plan to
                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more 
demand right now
                  than data center space,"" said Steve Porter, an account 
executive at Exodus in
                  Seattle. 

                       The booming market for co-location space has left some 
in the local utility
                  industry perplexed. 

                       ""It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do 
to serve the growth,""
                  said Seattle City Light's Royer. ""The utility industry is 
almost stunned by this, in
                  a way."""

Hi Phillip.  We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team
Selection information.

Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form
we sent you.  The information needed is then easily transferred into the
database directly from that Excel spreadsheet.  If you do not have the
ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still
require additional information.

We need each person's email address.  Without the email address, we cannot
email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can
we send them an automatic reminder via email.  It would also be good to have
each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.

So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need
to instead, provide the needed information via email.

Thank you for your assistance Phillip.

before and after bidweek.  



 




 The following observations can be made:

  July 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs 
actual of .79
   2.  Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91
   3.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

  Aug. 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs 
actual of .99
   2.  Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49
   3.  Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the 
monthly postings
   4.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

   

 Enron Online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against 
the index, as well as, spreads to other locations.  Please call with any 
questions.

 Can you give me more details or email  the plan prior to meeting?  What do I 
need to provide besides headcount?
 Otherwise any afternoon next week would be fine

Phillip"
2492,allen-p,"Colleen,

 Please add Mike Grigsby to the distribution.

 On another note, do you have any idea how Patti is holding up?

Phillip"
2493,allen-p,"Brad,

 With regard to Tori Kuykendall, I would like to promote her to commercial 
manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an 
associate.  Her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a 
commercial manager.  I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to 
others in that category at year end.  

 Martin Cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as Tori.  
Hunter would like Martin handled the same as Tori.

 Let me know if there are any issues.

Phillip"
2494,allen-p,"Bruce,

Can you stop by and set up my reuters.

Phillip"
2495,allen-p,"Lucy,

 The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better.  See if you can add 
these modifications:

 1.  Use a formula in column E.  Add the value in column C to column D.  It 
should read =c6+d6.  Then copy this formula to the rows below.

 2.  Column H needs a formula.  Subtract amount paid from amount owed.  
=e6-g6.

 3.  Column F is filled with the #### sign.  this is because the column width 
is too narrow.  Use you mouse to click on the line beside the 
       letter F.  Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.

 4.  After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to 
this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond.

Phillip"

 I got your email with the attachment.  Let's work together today to get this 
done

2502,allen-p,"Mac,

 Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:

  Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year
  
  Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf

  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 

   Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:
  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS 
X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share


 That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think 
crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.

 Current price 37
 Nat. Gas 34
 Crude  10

 Total  81

 
 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this 
looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, 
Tosco, and SLB?


Thank you,

Subject: TRANSPORTATION MODEL

Please plan to attend a meeting on Friday, August 11 at 11:15 a.m. in 30C1 to 
discuss the transportation model.  Now that we have had several traders 
managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss 
any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu 
(Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they 
will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this 
meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is 
comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those 
who are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have 
heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to 
discuss them.

Please let me know if you are unable to attend."

 Now that #44 is rented and you have settled in for a couple of months, we

 First, I want to implement the following changes:

  1.  No Overtime without my written (or email) instructions.
  2.  Daily timesheets for you and Wade faxed to me daily
  3.  Paychecks will be issued each Friday by me at the State Bank
  4.  No more expenditures on office or landscape than is necessary for basic 
operations.


 Moving on to the checkbook, I have attached a spreadsheet that organizes all 
the checks since Jan. 1.
 When you open the file, go to the ""Checkbook"" tab and look at the yellow 
highlighted items.  I have questions about these items.
 Please gather receipts so we can discuss.

Subject: Price for Stanfield Term

I am sending off a follow-up to a bid I submitted to Clark County PUD.  They 
have requested term pricing for Stanfield on a volume of 17,000.  Could you 
give me a basis for the period :

Sept -00 - May 31, 2006
Sept-00 - May 31, 2008

Since I assume you do not keep a Stanfield basis, but rather a basis off 
Malin or Rockies, it would probably make sense to show the basis as an 
adjustment to one of these point.  Also, what should the Mid - Offer Spread 
be on these terms.

Here are the net open Socal border positions we have for Elvis and Cactus.  
Let's try and set up a conference call with Phillip and John to talk about 
their offers at the back-end of their curves.

Roughly speaking, we are looking at a nominal 3750 MMBtu/d for 14 years from 
May 2010 on Elvis, and 3000 MMBtu/d on Cactus fromJune 2004 to April 2022.

Hey Phillip,
I received your note from Celeste.  I am the ENA Staffing Coordinator and 
need for you to fill out the attached Needs Assessment form before I can send 
you any resumes.  Also, would you be interested in the new class?  Analysts 
start with the business units on Aug. 3rd and Assoc. start on Aug. 28th.  We 
are starting to place the Associates and would like to see if you are 
interested.  Please let me know.  

Once I receive the Needs Assessment back (and you let me know if you can wait 
a month,) I will be happy to pull a couple of resumes for your review.  If 
you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

Enclosed is the cost breakdown for the appraiser.  Note that the
construction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our
standard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio
of 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.

Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs
are high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have
actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf
without overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.

It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairly
sure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.

I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are
$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3
bedroom.  Additional revenues could be generated by building detached
garages, which would rent for $50-75 per month.

This is a reminder !!!  If you haven't taken the time to update your GIS 
information, please do so.  It is essential that this function be performed 
as soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days 
ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to 
call Ted Bland @ 3-5275.

With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees 
between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to 
have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee 
data.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the 
year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC 
requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their 
profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education 
need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is 
accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to 
hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com 
on the command line of your browser.

The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would 
like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned 
for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please 
contact Kathy Schultea at x33841.  

Your  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.

Mark,

We are currently back-testing the storage model. 
The enclosed version contains deltas and decision 
variable. 

You mentioned that you have resources to run the model. Please do so.
This will help us to gain experience with the market vs the
model.

I am going to distribute an article by Caminus, an software vendor.
The article illustrates the optionality associated with storage operation
very well.  The Enron Research storage model  is a lot like that, although 
implementation may be
different.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

 I emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company.  I think 
I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from 
him.  Basically, they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some 
price that undercuts the current provider.  Then once their sales are large 
enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit.  
The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage 
the price risk.  This is my best guess.  I will get back to you with more.

Subject: Thoughts on Presentation

It is a shame that the CAISO doesn't provide actual generation by unit.  The 
WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, 
which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes 
the CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but 
there can be a siginificant difference between ""scheduled"" and ""actual"" 
generation.  You are pulling ""scheduled.""  If someone doesn't schedule their 
generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you 
will miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california 
munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, 
if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply 
schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said 
all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on 
the generation side.

On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While 
they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is 
better than the ""scheduled"" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the 
load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.

I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with 
others up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas 
demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, 
especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the 
UEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginal 
consumer then it is obviously a different story.

Let's talk."

Subject: Transport p&l

Phillip--
I've noticed one thing on your intra-month transport p&l that looks strange 
to me.  Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be 
an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is 
O.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to 
get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and 
I'll take care of it..

On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate 
curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of 
$235,019.   
(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your 
overall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects 
something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal 
#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.
  139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)
  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)
  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)
  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)
  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)
 Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to 
GDP-Kingsgate.

 Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five 
different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for 
withdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a 
Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is 
that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport 
losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  
I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a 
systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems 
that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, 
the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the 
detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it 
appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be 
an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar 
impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in 
case there's something you want to do about it.  The columns below show the 
volumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each.

Mike McDonald and I met with SW Gas this morning.  They were polite regarding 
asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to 
listen to a proposal.  However, they are very interested in weather hedges to 
protect throughput related earnings.  We are pursuing a confidentiality 
agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable 
us to develop proposals.  Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder 
value by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and by 
reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a 
weather product.

As to your other question.  We have yet to identify or pursue other 
candidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy 
to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our 
opportunities.  We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as we 
implement our strategy in California.

Are there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset 
management deal that we should approach?  Otherwise, we intend to

Janie,

Thanks for the fax on SW Gas.

We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to 
discuss asset management.  In preparation for that meeting we would like to 
gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  
Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are 
typical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  
How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main 
contacts at SW Gas?

We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our 
control of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably 
have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the 
commissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their 
commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) 
should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month 
index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That 
risk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of 
their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.

As to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are 
there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly 
appreciated.

Thanks,

Laird"

Phillip -
I applaud you for using your cycle as daily transportation.  Saves on gas, 
pollution and helps keep you strong and healthy.  Enron provides bike racks 
in the front of the building for requests such as this.  Phillip, I wish we 
could accommodate this request; however, The Body Shop does not have the 
capacity nor can assume the responsibility for storing cycles on a daily 
basis.  If you bring a very good lock you should be able to secure the bike 
at the designated outside racks.

the actual anticipated online date is May 2003.
 
The following list ranks the quality and quantity of information that I have

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack 
of Support
Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the 
bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a 
deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans 
and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is 
reportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and 
Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the 
bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double dip"" into 
the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and 
the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of 
the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  
Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term 
power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the 
bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of 
contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge 
loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very 
difficult.

The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state 
would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General 
Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 
billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this 
concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full 
disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the 
details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they 
will support the bond issuance to go forward.

Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB 
31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill 
passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of 
Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for 
community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be 
amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, 
currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should 
get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be 
likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). 
 
According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, 
Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money 
available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated 
that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  
Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The 
Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, 
Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and 
there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.
 
Key Points of the Bridge Financing
Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B
Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B
   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B
   Bear Stearns  $625 M
Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt
Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%
   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%
Current Projected 
Blended IR:  5.38%
Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001
For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510

Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time
The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the 
California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion 
authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be 
authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the 
additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing 
power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these 
authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the 
governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond 
amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to 
support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 
6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  
for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  
the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  
be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this 
idea  earlier in the crisis.
 
SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy
At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The 
first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the 
governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is 
August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According 
to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has 
signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis 
and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates 
that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary 
bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  

The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond 
issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) 
stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, 
then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the 
state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and 
passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for 
bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and 
the DWR proportionately from rate payments."

2694,allen-p,"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  
Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding 
the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business 
meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is 
even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try 
and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working 
and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet 
just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a 
round table discussion format.  

My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and 
jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time."

Subject: 4-URGENT - OWA Please print this now.


Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute ""john.doe"" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in ""corp/your user 
id"" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our 
Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.

On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its 
forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been 
lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the 
second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The 
outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some 
additional insight?

Thank you,

2709,allen-p,"Gary,

I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general 
contractor.  According to Johnnie, I would not be pay any less buying from 
the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within 
his region.  Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.  I believe 
he has sent you my plans.  They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.  

Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from 
the distributor?  If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you 
please email them to me as well?

Thank you for your time.  I am excited about potentially using your product.

Is there any detail on the gas cost proxy.  Which delivery points from which 
publication will be used?  Basically, can you help us get any clarification 
on the language ""the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in 
California""?

Phillip"
2711,allen-p,"Ned,

Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for 
this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current 
summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made 
to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal 
capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and 
withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 
existed at the time of this bid.

Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above 
assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.

I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email 
with comments.

Subject: Re: This morning's Commission meeting delayed  

Phil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed 
doors ""in smoke filled rooms"", if not directly between Commissioners then 
among FERC staffers.  Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that 
the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large 
part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which 
the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman 
began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or 
answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had 
some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:

Price caps are almost never the right answer
Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages
Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer
Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce 
demand, is not acceptable
Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would 
export California's problems to the West

This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty 
strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner 
out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and 
if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the 
agenda.  Hope this info helps.  Ray

Here is a photograph of a similar house.  The dimensions would be 56'Wide X 
41' Deep for the living area.  In addition there will be a 6' deep two story 
porch across the entire back and 30' across the front.  A modification to the 
front will be the addition of a gable across 25' on the left side.  The 
living area will be brought forward under this gable to be flush with the 
front porch.  

I don't have my floor plan with me at work today, but will bring in tomorrow 
and fax you a copy.

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially 
set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever 
the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very 
short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not 
match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.

Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic 
about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels 
into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my 
budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing 
the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.  
However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.

I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this 
product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you 
that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously 
consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in 
cost over stick built.

Please email your cost estimates when complete.

The back office is having a hard time dealing with the $11 million dollars 
that is to be recognized as transport expense by the west desk then recouped 
from the Office of the Chairman.    Is your understanding that the West desk 
will receive origination each month based on the schedule below.

 
 The Office of the Chairman agrees to grant origination to the Denver desk as 
follows:

October 2000  $1,395,000
November 2000 $1,350,000
December 2000 $1,395,000
January 2001  $   669,600
February 2001  $   604,800
March 2001  $   669,600
April 2001  $   648,000
May 2001  $   669,600
June 2001  $   648,000
July 2001  $   669,600
August 2001  $   669,600
September 2001 $   648,000
October 2001  $   669,600
November 2001 $   648,000
December 2001 $   669,600

This schedule represents a demand charge payable to NBP Energy Pipelines by 
the Denver desk.  The demand charge is $.18/MMBtu on 250,000 MMBtu/Day 
(Oct-00 thru Dec-00) and 120,000 MMBtu/Day (Jan-01 thru Dec-01).  The ENA 
Office of the Chairman has agreed to reimburse the west desk for this expense.

Let me know if you disagree.

Subject: CAISO demand reduction

Phillip et al.,

I have been digging into the answer to your question re: demand reduction in 
the West.  Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. 
March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand 
over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for 
temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates 
into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as 
compared with the previous year.

Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary 
reductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other 
forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making 
total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  
This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple 
more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% 
decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the 
retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it 
is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last 
year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in 
Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation 
are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of 
meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general 
economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least 
make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.

Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area 
only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC 
(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO 
portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in 
demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As 
you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum 
smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at 
least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its 
wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several 
mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are 
sharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly 
how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  
Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's 
economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of 
the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I 
think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already 
realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the 
non-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the 
WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around 
6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.

I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you 
with updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I 
hope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any 
questions or need any further information."

2749,allen-p,"Reagan,

I sent you an email last week stating that I would be in San Marcos on 
Friday, April 13th.  However, my closing has been postponed.  As I mentioned 
I am going to have Cary Kipp draw the plans for the residence and I will get 
back in touch with you once he is finished.

Regarding the multifamily project, I am going to work with a project manager 
from San Antonio.  For my first development project, I feel more comfortable 
with their experience obtaining FHA financing.  We are working with Kipp 
Flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings.  Your bid 
for the construction is competive with other construction estimates.  I am 
still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local 
relationships.  I will get back in touch with you once we have made the final 
determination on unit mix and site plan.

Phillip Allen"
2750,allen-p,"Jacques,

The amounts needed to fill in the blanks on Exhibit ""B"" are as follows:

Kipp Flores-Total Contract was $23,600 but $2,375 was paid and only $21,225 
is outstanding.

Kohutek- $2,150 

Cuatro- $37,800


George & Larry paid $3,500 for the appraisal and I agreed to reimburse this 
amount.

The total cash that Keith and I will pay the Sellers is $5,875 ($3,500 
appraisal and $2,375 engineering).    I couldn't find any reference to this 
cash consideration to be paid by the buyers.

Let me know if I need to do anything else before you can forward this to the  
sellers to be executed.

Regarding the employment agreement, Mike declined without a counter.  Keith 
said he would sign for $75K cash/$250 equity.  I still believe Frank should 
receive the same signing incentives as Keith.  

Phillip"
2753,allen-p,"Thanks for the response.  I think you are right that engaging an architect is 
the next logical step.  I had already contacted Cary Kipp and sent him the 
floor plan.
He got back to me yesterday with his first draft.  He took my plan and 
improved it.  I am going to officially engage Cary to draw the plans.  While 
he works on those I wanted to try and work out a detailed specification 
list.  Also, I would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and 
speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners.  I will be in San Marcos on Friday 
April 13th.  Are there any homes near completion that I could walk through 
that day?  Also can you provide some references?

Once I have the plans and specs, I will send them to you so you can adjust 
your bid.

Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)"

I am out of the office for the rest of the week.  Have you ever seen anyone 
miss as much work as I have in the last 6 weeks?  I assure you this is 
unusual for me.
Hopefully we can sign some documents on Monday.  Call me on my cell phone if 
you need me.

Phillip"
2760,allen-p,"Reagan,

I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts.

Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap?

What role would you play in obtaining financing?  Any experience with FHA 
221(d) loans?  

Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market 
quotes lower yet.  I have received estimates structured as follows:

  5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment
  2%- overhead
  4%- profit

I just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached an 
extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see even 
reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only 
generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about 
such a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down 
to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.  Any ideas?

I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you 
local connections.  I am not discounting those services.   I will be out of 
the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.

2761,allen-p,"Cary,

Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple
farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.

A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:

There will be a double porch across the back just like the front
No dormers (Metal roof)
1/2 bath under stairs
Overall dimensions are 55 by 40


What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More
cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.
Reagan
suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want
to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about
bringing the left
side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.
That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front
porch would
be smaller.

I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead
and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a
builder.
I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned
my alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed
sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan
allowed.

2767,allen-p,"Reagan,

Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence.  Below is a 
list of questions on the specs:

1.  Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine?  Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less 
and cost about the same?

2.  What type of floor joist would be used?  2x12 or some sort of factory 
joist?

3.  What type for roof framing?  On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?

4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  What 
type of insulation in floors and ceiling?  Batts or blown?  Fiberglass or 
Cellulose?

5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?

6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't know 
the difference between an apron and a stool.

7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent 
cracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?

8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partial 
one out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.

9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under 
the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.

10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermount 
stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.

11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.

12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?

13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?

14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Iron 
railings?

15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price except 
for change orders?

I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but 
this is a start.  I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.  I am going to 
call Cary Kipp to
see about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.

Phillip
I"
2768,allen-p,"Larry,

Jacques has sent a document to Claudia for your review.  Just dropping you a 
line to confirm that you have seen it.

Phillip"
2769,allen-p,"Jacques,

Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and 
architect?  They have both sent me agreements.  The only payment
that George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect.  I have written 
personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the 
engineer.
I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the 
partnership.  

I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the 
partnership not with me.  Should I wait until the partnership has been 
conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership.

Let me know what you think.

Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates:

Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf 
(rentable)

What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent?

Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again?  You mentioned 2% 
overhead, 3 %  ???, and 5% profit.

Why is profit only 4%? 

Why are the architect fees up to $200K.  I thought they would be $80K.

What is the $617K of profit allowance?  Is that the developers profit to 
boost loan amount but not a real cost?

Total Closing and Application costs of 350K?  That seems very high?  Who 
receives the 2 points?  How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us?

Where is your 1%?  Are you receiving one of the points on the loan?

What is the status on the operating pro forma?  My back of the envelope puts 
NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40% 
expenses.  After debt service that would only leave $122K.  The coverage 
would only be 1.16.

Talk to you this afternoon.

Mike is fine with signing a new contract (subject to reading the terms, of 
course).  He prefers to set strikes over a 3 month period.  His existing 
contract pays him a retention payment of $55,000 in the next week.  He still 
wants to receive this payment.

 Here is a photograhph of the house I have in mind.

 Specific features include:

 Stained and scored concrete floors downstairs
 Wood stairs
 Two story porches on front and rear
 Granite counters in kitchens and baths
 Tile floors in upstairs baths
 Metal roof w/ gutters (No dormers)
 Cherry or Maple cabinets in kitchen & baths
 Solid wood interior doors
 Windows fully trimmed
 Crown molding in downstairs living areas
 2x6 wall on west side

 Undecided items include:

 Vinyl or Aluminum windows
 Wood or carpet in upstairs bedrooms and game room
 Exterior stucco w/ stone apron and window trim  or rough white brick on 3-4 
sides
 
 
 I have faxed you the floor plans.  The dimensions may be to small to read.  
The overall dimensions are 55' X 40'.  For a total of 4400 sq ft under roof, 
but 
 only 3800 of livable space after you deduct the garage.  

 Are there any savings in the simplicity of the design?  It is basically a 
box with a simple roof 
 line.  Call me if you have any questions. 713-853-7041.

Something that I forgot to ask you.  Do you know if Hugo is planning to 
replatt using an administrative process which I understand is quicker than 
the full replatting process of 3 weeks?

Also let me know about the parking.  The builder in San Marcos believed the 
plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code.  The townhomes 
across the street have a serious parking problem.  They probably planned for 
the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms.

Phillip"
2778,allen-p,keith holst sent you an email with the details.
2779,allen-p,"Jacques,

The agreement looks fine.   My only comment is that George and Larry might 
object to the language that ""the bank that was requested to finance the 
construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs 
of the construction of the Project"".   Technically, that bank lowered the 
loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of 
equity that would be required. 

Did I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.

Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans, 
engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items are 
in a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speaking 
directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear on 
what is the best way to proceed with these consultants.  

The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do we 
need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and 
give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.

it is worked out today or tomorrow, I would like to get whatever documents

I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of 
value and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able to 
use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, 
appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in 
extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like 
earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I 
didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear 
this up.

Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.  
Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and 
the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand, 
conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was 
clean.  What is your inclination?

Call as soon as you have a chance to review.

FYI Western Price Survey Contacts

Cal-ISO's declaration of Stage Two alert this morning was triggered
in part by decision of Bonneville Power Administration to cease
hour-to-hour sales into California of between 600 MW and 1,000
MW that it had been making for the past week. According to BPA,
it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet
biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in
order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had
been telling California's Department of Water Resources that the
sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.

Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than
yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back.
Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because
of concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sending
exchange energy into California, however.

More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of the
Western Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter."

I am surprised to hear that the only restricted shares left are the ones

Subject: Bishops Corner, Ltd. -- Restructure or Buyout

Dear Phillip and Keith: 

We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash 
expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of 
all note obligations and design contracts.? 

As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and 
existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, 
and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which 
current unpaid invoices due total $37,325.

Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this 
project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design 
and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of 
our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or 
rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? 

Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a 
percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on 
your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, 
or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the 
second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per 
year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these 
valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the 
forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in 
the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future 
projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per 
month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the 
attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings 
the total net buyout to $78,946.? 

We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we 
offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout 
offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are 
prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? 
If this is your 



choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, 
Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then 
draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the 
Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout 
amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Here is the buyout spreadsheet again with a slight tweak in the format.  The 
summary  presents the numbers as only $1400 in concessions."
2802,allen-p,"Gentlemen,

Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to 
date.  I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property is 
still in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot 
and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a 
topographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to 
coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the 
smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going 
to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to 
complete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which 
$14,000 are due now for work completed.  

We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by 
the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can 
continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's 
number is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and 
ask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call 
and he was fine with that.  

Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp 
Flores can be used.

Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left very 
optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.

Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about 
moving this project forward.

work will be of any use to us.  I don't think they deserve any compensation 
for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were 
proposing was unsupportable by the market.  

My version of a buyout is attached.

I need your expert advise.  I am ready to offer my version or threaten to 
foreclose.  Do they have a case that they are due money for their time?  
Since their cost
and fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I 
wouldn't think they would stand a chance.  There isn't any time to waste so I 
want to respond to their offer asap.

Call me with your thoughts.

Phillip

Subject: Bishops Corner, Ltd. -- Restructure or Buyout

Dear Phillip and Keith: 

We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash 
expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of 
all note obligations and design contracts.? 

As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and 
existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, 
and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which 
current unpaid invoices due total $37,325.

Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this 
project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design 
and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of 
our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or 
rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? 

Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a 
percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on 
your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, 
or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the 
second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per 
year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these 
valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the 
forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in 
the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future 
projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per 
month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the 
attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings 
the total net buyout to $78,946.? 

We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we 
offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout 
offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are 
prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? 
If this is your 



choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, 
Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then 
draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the 
Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout 
amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

daily activity by backing out receipts, using ISO load actuals and backing 
out real time imports to get in state gen numbers for gas consumption, and 
then using temps to estimate core gas load.  Back testing once he gets

Subject:  Sagewood Phase II


George,

Thank you for the opportunity to review your financing request for the 
Sagewood
Phase II project.  Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the
project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are a
number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward
on the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a
Bedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjusted
pro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are
acheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about 
500+
units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, 
this,
we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious
effect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requested
loan amount to $8,868,000.

I have summarized our issues as follows:

1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:

     Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment
     Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR
     2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475
     3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417

2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit
turn over.

3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).

4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support
debt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x 
debt
coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.

5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.

6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide
equity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:

     Land -                   $1,121,670
     Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000
     Cash Equity              $1,419,268
     Total                    $2,955,938

7. Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage 
of
actual hard construction costs.

(See attached file: MAPTTRA.xls)




 - MAPTTRA.xls"
2812,allen-p,"Darrell,

Today I let the builder/developer know that I would not proceed with his 
excessively high cost estimates.  As he did not have the funds to take on the 
land himself, he was agreeable to turning over the land to me.  I would like 
to proceed and develop the property. 

 My thought is to compare the financing between Bank One and FHA.  I would 
also like to compare construction and development services between what you 
can do and a local builder in San Marcos that I have been speaking with.  
Making a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems to 
be in order.  I am trying to get the status of engineering and architectural 
work to date.  Once again the architect is Kipp Florres and the engineer is 
Quattro Consultants out of Buda.  Let me know if you have an opinion about 
either.

I look forward to working with you.  Talk to you tomorrow.

2821,allen-p,"George,

I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still have
the concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our
project are too high.  I have gathered more information that support my
concerns.  Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around
$10.5 million.  The components are as follows:

     Unit Cost, Site work, &
     builders profit($52/sf)             $7.6 million

     Land                      1.15

     Interim Financing               .85

     Common Areas                     .80

     Total                         $10.4

Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable
to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.

Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A
properties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can
produce the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for
location and the seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize
that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates
that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not
believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.
Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.

After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost
estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  He
feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8
million.  We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.

Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that
we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5
million.   We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon to 
discuss
alternatives.

Here are few questions regarding the 2/16 rentroll:

#2  Has she actually paid the $150 deposit.  Her move in date was 2/6.  It is 
not on any rentroll that I can see.

#9  Explain again what deposit and rent is transferring from #41 and when she 
will start paying on #9

#15  Since he has been such a good tenant for so long.  Stop trying to 
collect the $95 in question.

#33  Missed rent.  Are they still there?

#26  I see that she paid a deposit.  But the file says she moved in on 1/30.  
Has she ever paid rent?  I can't find any on the last three deposits.

#44  Have the paid for February?  There is no payment since the beginning of 
the year.

#33  You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't 
see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit?

The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent.  I need you to 
figure these out immediately.

I emailed you a new file for 2/23 and have attached the last three rentroll 
in case you need to research these questions.

2829,allen-p,"George,

 The San Marcos project is sounding very attractive.  I have one other 
investor in addition to Keith that has interest.  Some additional background 
information on Larry and yourself would be helpful.

 Background Questions:
 
 Please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in 
Creekside.

 Please list projects completed during the last 5 years.  Include the project 
description, investors, business entity, 

 Please provide the names and numbers of prior investors.

 Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on 
recent projects.


 With regard to the proposed investment structure, I would suggest a couple 
of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between Creekside and the 
investors. 


 Preferable Investment Structure:

 Developers guarantee note, not investors.

 Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing.

 Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns.

         Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should 
tackle these issues now.  These questions are not intended to be offensive in 
any way.  It is my desire to build a successful project with Creekside that 
leads to future opportunities.  I  am happy to provide you with any 
information that you need to evaluate myself or Keith as a business partner.

Phillip -

George Richards asked that I drop you a line this morning to go over some
details on the San Marcos project.

1.  First, do you know if I am to receive a personal financial statement from
Keith?  I want to make sure my credit write-up includes all the principals in
the transaction.

2.  Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC) 
will
be in the range of 75% - 80%.  The proposed Loan to Value of 75% is within the
acceptable range for a typical Multi-Family deal.  Given the above pro-forma
performance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my credit
officer as an 80% LTC.  This, of course, is subject to the credit officer
signing off on the deal.

3.  The Bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the Developers
deferred profit.  Typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget as
deferred profit has been acceptable.

Thanks,

There have been some updates to the cost.  The principal change is in the
addition of masonry on the front of the buildings, which I estimate will
costs at least $84,000 additional.  Also, the trim material and labor costs
have been increased.  I still believe that the total cost is more than
sufficient, but there will be additional updates.

The manager's unit is columns J-L, but the total is not included in the B&N
total of rentable units.  Rather, the total cost for the manager's unit and
office is included as a lump sum under amenities.  I may add this back in as
a rentable unit and delete is as an amenity.

The financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanent
mortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for the
construction loan approval, therefore, its cost will be absorbed when this
loan is obtained.

Based on either a loan equal to 75% of value or 80% of cost, the
construction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land.

Phillip,

I spoke with AMF's broker today, and they will be satisfied with the deal if
we can get the school to agree to limit the current land use restrictions to
the terms that are in the existing agreement.  They do not want the school
to come back at a later date for something different.  Doug Bell will meet
with a school official on Monday to see what their thoughts are about the
subject.  It would be hard for them to change the current agreement, but AMF
wants something in writing to that effect.  I spoke to AMF's attorney today,
and explained the situation.  They are OK with deal if AMF is satisfied.

AMF's broker said that they will be ready to submit their site plan after
the March 29 hearing.  We may close this deal in April.

The Stage is still on go.  An assumption package has been sent to the buyer,
and I have overnighted a copy of the contract and a description of the
details to Wayne McCoy.

I will be gone Thurs. and Fri. of this week.  I will be checking my
messages.

Gay was on a personal leave.  She displayed a tremendous amount of commitment 
to the west desk during that time.  She frequently came to work before 4 AM 
to prepare operations reports.  Patti worked 7 days a week during this time.  
If long hours were not enough, there was a pipeline explosion during this

She didn't crack and provided much needed info during this time.

Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies 
forecasts?  I will set up a room with Kim.

Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen:

1.  Review and document systems and processes  -   The handoffs from ERMS, 
TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the 
       parties trying to make improvements.  I think I understand ERMS and 
TAGG but the issues facing 
       scheduling in Unify are grey.

2.  Review and audit complex deals- Under the ""assume it is messed up"" 
policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need 
further      scrutiny.

3.  Review risk books-  Is Enron accurately accounting for physical 
imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?

4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design training 
courses, review progress and make cuts.

5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.  Are we looking at 
everything we should?  Putting a person with a trading mentality should add 
   some value and direction to the group.


In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD 
to work part time to get it done.

2849,allen-p,"Jaques,

After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different 
definitions of cost and profit.  Their version includes the salary of a 
superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third 
party subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of ""construction management"" 
fees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be 
paid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finally 
the builders profit of 1.4 million.

Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out 
of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, if 
they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?  
We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition 
to the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have been 
in the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates and 
the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management 
fee is included.

George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  I will 
review and let you know what I think.

The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention.  They are agreeable to 
the 3 out 4 approval process.

Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  only 
true costs + 1.4 million.

Here is the 2/2 rentroll.  The total does not equal the bank deposit.  Your 
earlier response answered the questions for #3,11,15,20a, and 35.

But the deposit was $495 more than the rentroll adds up to.  If the answer to 
this question lies in apartment 1,13, and 14, can you update this file and 
send it back.

Now I am going to work on a rentroll for this Friday.  I will probably send 
you some questions about the 2/9 rentroll.  Let's get this stuff clean today.

Phillip these are the volumes that AEC is considering selling at Opal over 
the next five years.  The structure they are looking for is a firm physical 
sale at a NYMEX related price.  There is a very good chance that they will do 
this all with one party.  We are definitely being considered as that party.  
Given what we have seen in the marketplace they may be one of the few 
producers willing to sell long dated physical gas for size into Kern River.

What would be your bid for this gas?

This should probably be researched further.  If they can really build this 
many plants it could have a huge impact on the Cal border basis.  Obviously 
it is dependent on what capacity is added on Kern, PGT and TW but it is hard 
to envision enough subscriptions to meet this demand.  Even if it is 
subscribed it will take 18 months to 2 years to build new pipe therefore the 
El Paso 1.2 Bcf/d could be even more valuable.

Here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject 
to caps.  I wrote it as if it were from you.  It should come from the manager.

It is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there 
unit is when they move in.  This needs to be written in on their lease.

When you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize 
that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up.  

Have my Dad read the memo before you put it out.   You guys can make changes 
if you need to.





Next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and 
refrigerators.  We have to get this done next week.  I will email you a form 
to use to record serial numbers.  The prospective buyers want this 
information plus we need it for our records.  Something to look forward to.

It is 2 PM and I have to leave the office.  Please have my Dad call me with

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards
President, Creekside Builders, LLC

2874,allen-p,"Lucy,

Here is the rentroll for this Friday.  Sorry it is so late.



There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2.

1.  I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank 
is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865.   The missing money on the 
spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.

2.  #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?

3.  #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?

4.  #11 Missed on 2/2?

5.  #13 Missed on 1/26?

6.  #14  missed on 2/2?

7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?

8.  #20a missed on 2/2?

9.  #35 missed on 2/2?

My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.  
You may have sent me a message over the ""chat"" line that I don't remember on 
some of these.  I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the 
bank deposit.

Will have some time today to work on a utility letter.  Tried to call Wade 
last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him.  Will try again today.

I believe that a doctor from Seguin is going to make an offer.  Did you meet 
them?  If so, what did you think?

Phillip"
2875,allen-p,"I will email you an updated operating statement with Nov and Dec tomorrow 
morning.  What did the seguin doctor think of the place.  

How much could I get the stagecoach appraised for?  Do you still do 
appraisals?  Could it be valued on an 11 or 12 cap?"
2876,allen-p,"Jacques,

Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract?  

The key business points are:

1.  Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate

2.  Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million

3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.

4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?

5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.

With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a 
solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes 
costs.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and I 
would like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to fax 
all invoices within 48 hours.  We also would want online access to the 
checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing 
but invoices were not being submitted.

Let me know if you can draft these agreements.  The GP issue may need some 
tweaking.

My target is to get $225 back out of the stage.  Therefore, I could take a 
sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K.  This would still only 
require $75K cash from the buyer.  After broker fees and a title policy, I 
would net around $20K cash.  

You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or 
higher with the terms described in the 1st email.  Do you want to give the 
New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal.


Phillip"
2881,allen-p,"Jeff,

I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 
years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%.  There are several 
reasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, the 
large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer 
are the three biggest concerns.  

What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the 
buyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come due 
until September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold the 
property.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to make 
the deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinance 
is pushing too far.

Can you clarify the dates in the contract.  Is the effective date the day the 
earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?

Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.  I got your fax from the New 
Braunfels buyer.  If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get 
started on the list.

Email or call  me later today.

When we meet,  I would like to address the following issues:

1.)  I had at least 5 people here past midnight on both nights and I have 
several people who have not left before 10:30 this week. 
2.)  It is my understanding that Susan was still booking new day deals on 
Thursday night at 8:30 b/c she did not get deal tickets from the trading 
floor until after 5:00 p.m.
3.)  It is also my understanding that Susan is done with the p&l and 
benchmark part of her book often times by 6:00,  but that what keeps her here 
late is usually running numerous extra models and spreadsheets.  (One 
suggestion might be a permanent IT person on this book.)  (This was also my 
understanding from Kyle Etter,  who has left the company.)

I would like to get this resolved as soon as possible so that Larry can get 
the information that he needs to be effective and so that we can run books 
like this and not lose good people.

Thanks

 Regarding Patti Sullivan's contributions to the west desk this year, her 
efforts deserve recognition and a PBR award.  Patti stepped up to fill the 
gap left by Randy Gay's personal leave.  Patti held together the scheduling 
group for about 2 month's by working 7days a week during this time.  Patti 
was always the first one in the office during this time.  Frequently, she 
would be at work before 4 AM to prepare the daily operation package.  All the 
traders came to depend on the information Patti provided.   This information 
has been extremely critical this year due to the pipeline explosion and size 
of the west desk positions.  
 Please call to discuss cash award.

Please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the ""Rent Due"" column.  The 
other questions I had about last week's rent are:

#15  Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26.  What is 
going on?

#25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit

#27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.  Why?

I spoke to Jeff Smith.  I think he was surprised that we were set up with 
email and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff know 
that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the 
property.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show 
them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.  

Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right 
now.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet 
but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wade 
continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the 
property's tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better and 
better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.  

Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  It 
is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move 
in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  I 
realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and 
your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be 
working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running 
an errand for the property.

I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this 
time.  We can look at again later in the year.

I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.

The probability of building a house this year is increasing.  I have shifted 
to a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I could 
not work out in the plan we discussed previously.  Now, I am leaning more 
towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  One 
wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 
kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage + 
guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  This 
plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the 
courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor 
living.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. 
 The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass 
skylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to have 
single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.  

I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.  I would 
like to come and visit you again this month.  If it would work for you, I 
would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.  I 
would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we 
didn't have time for.  I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan.

 Are you available at 5:30 ET today?

Phillip"
2896,allen-p,"Jeff,

Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about.

1.  Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and 
repairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor 
cost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on 
repairs.

2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite 
manager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has 
interest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager 
that could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to a 
management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager 
onsite.

3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If you 
want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.

4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structure 
this deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.

My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.  This property 
definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.


Sales Price  705,000

1st Lien   473,500

2nd Lien  225,000

Transfer fee    7,500

Cash required   14,500


NOI   100,000

1st Lien    47,292

2nd Lien   23,694

Cash flow  29,014

Cash on cash  200%


These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then 
cash on cash return would be more like 300%.   This doesn't reflect the 
additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years 
for a higher price.

Do you want to reconsider?  Let me know.

=09=09 Subject: CPUC Audit Report on Edison

The following are the highlights from the Executive Summary of the KPMG aud=
it=20
report on Southern California Edison:
=20
I. Cash Needs
Highlights:
SCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=
plete=20
cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20
program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=
s=20
and other measures.=20
Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20
available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=
.8=20
million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20
conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.
II. Credit Relationships
Highlights:
SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20
extend or renew credit as it has become due.
At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.
SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=
lt.=20
Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=
nd=20
payable.
SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond=
=20
indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20
indebtedness if it were feasible to do so.
Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =
its=20
rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade=
=20
issues within the last three weeks.
III. Energy Cost Scenarios
Highlights
This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20
various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=
 such=20
scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.
IV. Cost Containment Initiatives
Highlights
SCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.
The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital=
=20
improvement component as follows (in millions):
Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77
Capital Improvement Costs                383
Total                                             $ 460
The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to=
=20
be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=
om=20
contract employees.
Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the=
=20
most part being deferred to a future date.
SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20
executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20
savings of approximately $92 million.
V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20
Activity)
Highlights:
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20
Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20
includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20
million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s=
=20
Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.
Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=
e=20
end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit=
=20
balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20
D.01-01-018.
Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20
generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20
tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20
expressed in the TRA, are overstated.
TURN Proposal
As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=
RN=20
to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=
s.=20
Our comments are summarized as follows:
The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=
t=20
would not directly generate nor use cash.
The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=
ift=20
costs between two regulatory assets.
TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=
 the=20
revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =
in=20
the TRA is overstated.
VI. Flow of Funds Analysis
Highlights:
In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a=
=20
positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.
During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to=
=20
its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.
Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its=
=20
shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=
on=20
stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=
ve=20
and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.
[there is no Section VII]
=20
VIII. Earnings of California Affiliates
SCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500=
=20
million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20
In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.=
=20
This increase correlates to the increase in market prices
for natural gas for the same period.

That is good news about Leander.  

Now for the stage.  I would like to get it sold by the end of March.   I have 
about $225K invested in the stagecoach, 
 it looks like I need to get around $745K to breakeven.  

I don't need the cash out right now so if I could get a personal guarantee 
and Jaques Craig can 
work out the partnership transfer, I would definitely be willing to carry a 
second lien.  I understand second liens are going for 10%-12%.
Checkout this spreadsheet.





These numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes.   
However,  I am very concerned about the way it is being shown.  Having Lucy 
show it is not a good idea.  I need you to meet the buyers and take some 
trips over to get more familar with the property.  My dad doesn't have the 
time and I don't trust 
Lucy or Wade to show it correctly.  I would prefer for you to show it from 
now on.  

I will have the operating statements complete through December by this 
Friday.

Subject: Re: SM134  

George,

Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders 
profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be 
recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would 
be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.



Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the 
investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned 
earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as 
part of the construction contract.  

Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look 
like here are a few ideas:

 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from 
higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.

 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 
1 complete in November)
      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule
      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule

This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but 
could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule 
must be discussed and agreed upon.

Subject: Status of QF negotiations on QFs & Legislative Update

Phillip:

It looks like a deal with the non gas fired QFs is iminent.  One for the gas 
generators is still quite a ways off.  

The non gas fired QFs will be getting a fixed price for 5 years and reverting 
back to their contracts thereafter.  They also will give back 

I would expect that the gas deal using an implied gas price times a heat rate 
would be very very difficult to close.  Don't expect hedgers to come any time 
soon.

I will keep you abreast of developments.

Subject: Status of QF negotiations on QFs & Legislative Update

This from a conference call with IEP tonight at 5 pm:

RE;  Non-Gas-fired QFs -- The last e-mail I sent includes the latest version 
of the IEP proposal.  Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially 
complete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed with 
the IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would ""retain"" $106 million (of 
what, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who 
switched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the 
QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December 
(and maybe earlier).

PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the 
Force Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get 
some assurances of payment. 

SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due 
on 2/2/01.

For gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E's 
purchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements 
(Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be 
resolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.  No discussions on this 
occurred today.

Status of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will 
happen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.  
Plan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg's new bill .  Hydro as security is 
dead. Republicans were very much opposed to it."
2910,allen-p,"Patti,

This sounds like an opportunity to land a couple of analyst to fill the gaps 
in scheduling.  Remember their rotations last for one year.  Do you want to 
be an interviewer?

Subject: Analyst Interviews Needed - 2/15/01


	

All,

The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that 
need to be addressed immediately.  While we anticipate many new Analysts 
joining Enron this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it 
necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting 
event.  We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting 
approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed.  I am asking that you forward 
this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above).  We will conduct 
first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the 
afternoon.  We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning 
(9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session.  Please submit your 
response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date.  In 
addition, we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking 
one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer.   Thanks in 
advance for your cooperation.

  


Thank you,
Jana"
2911,allen-p,"Nick,

There is a specific program that we are using to recruit, train, and mentor 
new traders on the gas and power desks.    The trading track program is being 
coordinated by Ted Bland.  I have forwarded him your resume.  Give him a call 
and he will fill you in on the details of the program.

#32 and #29 are fine.  

#28 paid weekly on 1/5.  Then he switched to biweekly.  He should have paid 
260 on 1/12.  Two weeks rent in advance.  Instead he paid 260 on 1/19.  He 
either needs to get back on schedule or let him know he is paying in the 
middle of his two weeks.  He is only paid one week in advance.  This is not a 
big deal, but you should be clear with tenants that rent is due in advance.

Here is an updated rentroll.  Please use this one instead of the one I sent 
you this morning.

Finally, can you fax me the application and lease from #9.

2919,allen-p,"By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City Star
Date: 01/20/01 22:15

As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile 
Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas 
storage number. 

The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the 
forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a 
supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. 

""Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,"" said William Burson, 
a trader. ""It makes the market for natural gas."" 

But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas 
Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the 
storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the 
numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than 
reality. 

""It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what 
we are reporting,"" McGill said. 

As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- 
and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing 
fingers at Wall Street. 

Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently 
stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for 
the rise in gas prices. 

""It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,"" Adik 
told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. 

In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric 
utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. 

Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame 
for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their 
customers and constituents from such price spikes. 

Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take 
precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price 
insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas 
prices before they soared. 

""We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said Paul 
Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. 

But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. 

""There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to 
change,"" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security 
Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. 


Hot topic 

Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In 
many circles, little else is discussed. 

The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is 
facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the 
previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as 
well. 

The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of 
his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial 
pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. 

""It's the talk of the town here,"" he said. 

A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per 
thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile 
to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by 
customers. 

But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand 
cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage 
for winter. 

There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, 
prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information 
Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating 
bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. 

But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, 
including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas 
markets. 

""It's all about the weather,"" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. 

Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York 
traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile 
commodity in the world. 


Setting the price 

In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of 
gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading 
contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had 
widespread influence over gas prices. 

The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon 
as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale 
prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from 
utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what 
they pay for the gas they expect to use. 

There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention 
of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge 
of natural gas. 

But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to 
know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all 
futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to 
their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money 
in a short time. 

As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less 
than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. 
Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's 
weekly storage numbers. 

Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to 
need in the winter. 

Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than 
average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in 
hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. 

Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be 
sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the 
concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. 

Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage 
numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the 
association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. 

But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice 
president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had 
continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. 

""I was getting worried,"" he said. 

Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. 
Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices 
dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. 


Just passing through 

Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but 
pass their fuel costs on to customers. 

Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas 
charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas 
Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. 

Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last 
month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could 
be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve 
energy. 

Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to 
save an average customer about $25 this winter. 

Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an 
extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not 
guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. 

Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left 
customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether 
they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel 
costs. 

On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public 
Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to 
perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. 

""Consumers are taking all the risk,"" Micheel said. ""It's time to consider 
some changes.""

Enron has agreed that the key issue is to focus on solving the S-T buying 
needs.  Attached is a spreadsheet that outlines the $ magnitude of the next 
few months.

TALKING POINTS:

Lot's of questions about DWR becoming the  vehicle for S-T buying and there 
is a significant legal risk for it becoming the vehicle.  WE DO NEED 
SOMETHING TO BRIDGE BEFORE WE PUT IN L-T CONTRACTS.
Huge and growing shortfall ($3.2B through March 31, 2001) 
The SOONER YOU CAN PUT IN L-T CONTRACTS STOP THE BLEEDING.
Bankruptcy takes all authority out of the Legislature's hands.

ACTION ITEMS:

1. Energy Sales Participation Agreement During Bankruptcy

Michael Tribolet will be contacting John Klauberg to discuss how to organize 
a Participation Agreement to sell to UDCs in Bankruptcy while securing Super 
Priority.

2. Legislative Language for CDWR (?) Buying Short-Term

Sandi McCubbin / Jeff Dasovich will lead team to offer new language to meet 
S-T requirements of UDCs.  Key is to talk with State of California Treasurer 
to see if the $ can be found or provided to private firms.  ($3.5B by end of 
April).  Pat Boylston will develop ""public benefit"" language for options 
working with Mike Day.  He can be reached at 503-294-9116 or 
pgboylston@stoel.com.

3. Get Team to Sacramento

Get with Hertzberg to discuss the options (Bev Hansen).  Explain the 
magnitude of the problem.  Get Mike Day to help draft language.  

4. See if UDCs have any Thoughts

Steve Kean will communicate with UDCs to see if they have any solutions or 
thougths.  Probably of limited value.

5. Update List

Any new information on this should be communicated to the following people as 
soon as possible.  These people should update their respective business units.

2936,allen-p,"George,

Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders 
profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be 
recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would 
be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.



Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the 
investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned 
earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as 
part of the construction contract.  

Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look 
like here are a few ideas:

 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from 
higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.

 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 
1 complete in November)
      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule
      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule

This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but 
could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule 
must be discussed and agreed upon.

are alot of overages.  It will probably get worse this month because of all 
the cold weather.

You need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap.  
This needs to be handwritten on all new leases.

I am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet.  We 
also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need 
to conserve energy if they don't want to exceed their cap.  I will write 
something today.



Wait until you have copies of the bills and the letter before you start 
collecting.

2942,allen-p,"Questions about 12/29 rentroll:

 There were two deposits that were not labeled.  One for $150 and the other 
for $75.  Which apartments?  20a or #13?

 Utility overages for #26 and #44?  Where did you get these amounts?  For 
what periods?

 
What is going on with #42.   Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!!  
That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money 
and time remodeling.  I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first 
asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like 
leaky pipes.  If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the 
apartment and charge them for the labor.  Then we will perform monthly 
inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property.  This tenant has 
been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off.

I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so 
I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank.  Is this 
right?  Has the deposit been made yet?


 A rentroll for Jan 5th will follow shortly.

Subject: Meeting with Governor Davis, need for additional comments/suggestions

We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA.  In attendance were Ken Lay, 
the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. 
spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his 
ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next 
week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.  
Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on 
my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff 
Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our 
proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation 
based on the governor's comments:

Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that 
we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing 
communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to 
go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what 
the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more 
work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He 
talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail 
level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the 
benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he 
would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power 
(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented 
solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix 
the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.
Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also 
included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed 
interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a 
goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities 
to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate 
analysts and other ""nonadvocates"" to develop solutions to a number of issues 
including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  
He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas 
purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding 
some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.
His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously 
under serious consideration and some of which were mere ""brainstorming"".  
Some of these ideas would require legislative action.
State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a ""couple"" of 
generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that 
they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This 
was a frequently recurring theme.
Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus 
basis to consumers.
Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in 
California.
State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more 
widely deploy distributed generation.
Expand in-state gas production.
Take state lands gas royalties in kind.
negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for 
addtional gas supplies.
Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant 
maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at 
any one time.
Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.
Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear 
more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be 
able to help out here).
Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made 
some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy 
some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation 
thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control 
approach with generators.
Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.
To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's 
thoughts and get them to Kari)
He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- 
not just the 5 one year strips.
He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.
He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the 
deal.
He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the 
forward contracting issues.
Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today."

2949,allen-p,"Gentlemen,

 I continue to speak to an attorney for help with the investment structure 
and a mortgage broker for help with the financing.  Regarding the financing, 
I am working with Jim Murnan at Pinnacle Mortgage here in Houston.  I have 
sent him some information on the project, but he needs financial information 
on you.  Can you please send it to him.  His contact information is:  phone

 I know Larry has been working with a bank and they need my information.  I 
hope to pull that together this afternoon.

 I took the liberty of calling Thomas Reames from the Frog Pond document.  He 
was positive about his experience overall.  He did not seem pleased with the 
bookkeeping or information flow to the investor.  I think we should discuss 
these procedures in advance.

 I would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project I 
described to you last week.  The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in 
San Marcos.  There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a 
couple of other investors involved.  As I mentioned last week, I would like 
to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not 
require the investors to personally guarantee.  If there is a creative way to 
structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.  One idea that has 
been mentioned is to obtain a ""forward commitment"" in order to reduce the 
equity required.  I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this 
nature are normally financed.  Specifically, the transition from interim to 
permanent financing.  I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be 
important to banks. 

 I am faxing you a project summary.  And I will have the builder/developer 
email or fax his financial statement to you.

 Let me know what else you need.  The land is scheduled to close mid January.

2952,allen-p,"Jeff,

Everything should be done for closing on the Leander deal on the 29th.  I 
have fed ex'd the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out 
tomorrow.    When will more money be required?  Escrow for roads?  Utility 
connections?  Other rezoning costs?  

What about property taxes?  The burnet land lost its ag exemption while I 
owned it.  Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this 
property?  Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes 
once the property is rezoned?  Do we need to find a farmer and give him 
grazing rights?

What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and 
annexing?  I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and 
American Multifamily walking on this deal.  So I just want to make sure we 
are pushing the process as fast as we can.

Phillip"
2953,allen-p,"Steve,


I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.  If 
you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.









As far as recommendations, here is a short list:

 1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales 
above monthly index without enough consideration of future 
      replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be 
injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.
                    This creates a shortage in later months.

 2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet 
demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.  
                      Specific questions should include:  

  1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order 
to fill storage?

  2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too 
much gas from Socal's system.  
       I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their 
own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than 
their injection capablity, but injected far less.

 3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short 
term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major 
                    LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating 
rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market 
and the 
     consumer has benefitted.  


Call me if you need any more input.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list

Phillip,
 Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, 
on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic 
consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time 
consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the 
inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can 
arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the 
future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 
The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to 
themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this 
project.

I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now 
we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list


From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated 
positions, I think we still have the following issues:
We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had 
three meetings which brought out very different issues from different 
traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader 
requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.
We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to 
be outside the scope of position consolidation.

Things left to do:
I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to 
make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this 
project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.
Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this 
project and which fall out of scope.
For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and 
work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.
Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all 
drill downs.
Use the above to formulate a project plan.

Things requested thus far (no particular order):
Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal 
ticker.
Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that 
add up existing position manager rows/columns).
New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, 
transport, swaps, options, ...
Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values 
of all curves on which the desk has a position.
Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be 
shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid 
would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.
Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the 
appropriate positions to show for each:
Gas Daily for monthly index,
Physical gas for Nymex,
Physical gas for Inside Ferc,
Physical gas for Mid market.
Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of 
using official valuations.
Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.
Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:
Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility 
skew and correlations.
Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  
Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a 
gamma grid.
Valuation of Gas Daily options.
A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.
Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.
Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position 
manager.
Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, 
prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.
Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.
Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of 
individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.
Benchmark positions in TDS.
Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit 
and explicit position break out issues.

-- Allan.

PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for 
transport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that 
point."

13:18 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Cal-ISO Pays $10M To Avoid Rolling Blackouts
Wed -Sources
(This article was originally published Wednesday)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Independent System Operator paid
about $10 million Wednesday for 1,000 megawatts of power from Powerex and
still faced a massive deficit that threatened electricity reliability in the
state, high-ranking market sources familiar with the ISO's operation told
Dow Jones Newswires.
But the ISO fell short of ordering rolling blackouts Wednesday for the third
consecutive day.
The ISO wouldn't comment on the transactions, saying it is sensitive market
information. But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia
Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest
region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid
about $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.
But that still wasn't enough juice.
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts
of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of
$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts
of power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the
$250/MWh price cap.
The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The
municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power
into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP
is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit
claims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville
Power Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the
market at prices 10 times higher.
Powerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying all
transactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000
megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts
- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.
The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state
no matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,
which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having
to compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing
to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.
The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during
a conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency
Wednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared
when the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is
interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.
But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as
a means of attracting additional electricity resources.
""In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,""
Dorinson said.
Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy
unit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &
Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of
the high-priced power.
SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high
wholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by
nearly $1 billion, analysts said. It's still unclear whether retail
customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity
rates or if companies will absorb the costs.

13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South Bay
Pwr Plant
(This article was originally published Wednesday)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California Independent
System Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke Energy
Corp.'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,
Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.
The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state
since Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the
reasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.
About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday,
7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the
ISO.
The ISO manages grid reliability.
As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert
at 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would
dip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid
collapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rolling
blackouts.
The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),
Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE).
Duke's 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representatives
in June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said.

Power Plants
(This article was originally published Wednesday)

   By Jessica Berthold
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--AES Corp. (AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said
Wednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by
some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate
reasons.
The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power
grid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public
Utilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power
plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns,
ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.
The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for
unplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency
for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and
customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be
called on to do so.
As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)
said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday
evening.
Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES
and Dynegy Tuesday evening.
AES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspection
of the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday
morning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron
Thomas said.
Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representatives
returned Wednesday for a full inspection.

   AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits

The Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have
used up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken down
two weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality
Management District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,
Thomas said.
AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire
Huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos
and Redondo Beach plants.
The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES
has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the
company $20 million for polluting.
""We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it,""
Thomas said. ""It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality
district's"" authority.
As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES
could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off
line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.

   Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC

Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday
evening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line
Wednesday.
""I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if you
need to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'"" said Dynegy
spokesman Lynn Lednicky.
Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and
the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could
pose a safety hazard if not repaired.
""We've been doing all we can to get back in service,"" Lednicky said. ""We
even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.""
Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation of
why its units were off line.

Westgate

Enclosed are demographics on the Westgate site from Investor's Alliance.
Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package
on San Marcos that you received earlier.
If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know.
Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project?

San Marcos
The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for
sale and approved for 134 units.  The land is selling for $2.50 per square
foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West
San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.

Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes
and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25
per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and
$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This
property will have the best location for student housing of all new
projects, just as the duplexes do now.

If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there
is a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not
yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will
know more on this question later today.

Sincerely,

Liane,

 As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt to 
manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  It appears that a single 
buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above 
market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades, 
offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were 
bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index 
calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated 
financial swaps for San Juan.

 We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from 
September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from 
Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage 
firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a 
trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas 
daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread 
relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:

 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater 
than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 

 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & 
Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and 
       October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that 
are dramatically different.


 I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the 
trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to 
determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are 
outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in 
establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at 
$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the 
calculation of index.

 It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to 
conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me 
anytime I can assist you towards this goal.

Sincerely,

Phillip Allen"

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards
President, Creekside Builders, LLC

Subject: closing



Jeff, 
?
Is the closing today?? After reviewing the  agreement?I find it isn't binding 
as far as I can determine.? It is  too vague and it doesn't sound like 
anything an attorney or title company  would?draft for a real estate 
closing--but, of course, I could be  wrong.? 
?
If this?closing is going to take place without  this agreement then there is 
no point in me  following up on this?document's validity.? 
?
I will just need to go back to my closing documents  and see what's there and 
find out where I am with that and deal with this as  best I can.
?
I guess I was expecting something that would be an  exhibit to a recordable 
document or something a little more exact, or  rather?sort of a contract.? 
This isn't either.? I tried to get a  real estate atty on the phone last 
night but he was out of pocket.? I  talked to a crim. atty friend and he said 
this is out of his area but doesn't  sound binding to him.? 
?
I will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's  transaction?and take a look at 
that but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature? is even 
needed to complete this transaction.?  I am in after 12 noon if there is any 
need to contact me regarding the  closing.
?
I really do not want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myself 
and I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn't 
seem to be something required for a closing.? In  the event you do need my 
signature on something like this I would rather have  time to have it 
reviewed before I accept it.
?

3008,allen-p,"George,

 Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate 
project:

 Ownership Structure

 What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner?

 What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what 
capacity(regarding ownership and 
 liabilities)?

 Who owns the land? improvements?

 Who holds the various loans?

 Is the land collateral?

 Investment
 
 What happens to initial investment?

 Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?
 
 Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?

 When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment 
schedule?

 Investment Return

 Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?

 Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits 
are distributed?

 Debt

 Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral 
is associated with each 
 loan?

 Improvement

 Construction

 Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.

 Terms of each loan?

 Uses of Funds

 How will disbursements be made?  By whom?

 What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing 
for investors?

 Reports to track expenses vs plan?

 Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?

 What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get 
paid a markup on subcontractors as a 
 general contractor and paid gain out of profits?

 Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses 
before the ultimate payout of profits?

 Design and Construction
 
 When will design be complete?

 What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?

 What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction 
planning and permitting?

 Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, 
vendors, and other professionals? 
 Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?

 Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to 
use? Names?

These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor 
in a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn as
much as possible from the process.

Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls


Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

3010,allen-p,"George,

 Here sales numbers from Reagan:

 
 

 As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The 
1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the 
units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units 
under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with 
competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals 
actually done to date.   

 Let me know what you think.  I will follow up with an email and phone call 
about Cherry Creek.  I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was 
rejected on the De Ville property.

 You would clearly receive a commission on a deal on the sagewood. 

  I am surprised by your request for payment on any type of project in which  
I might become involved with Creekside.  Are you in the business of brokering 
properties or contacts?  Is your position based on a legal or what you 
perceive to be an ethical issue?  Did you propose we look at developing a 
project from scratch?

 I am not prepared to pay more than 2.7 for sagewood yet.

I was aware that Regan Lehman, the lot developer for the entire 70 lot
duplex project, was selling his units in the $180's,  He does have a much
lower basis in the lots than anyone else, but the prime differences are due
to a) he is selling them during construction and b) they are smaller units.
We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of
the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan.  This would produce an average sq
footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his
sales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell
for $203,108.
What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the
rent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own
evaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the
3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we
were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom
units along with the 3-bedroom plan.
Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.
Sincerely,
George W. Richards

Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls


Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

Why am I not surprised ?

I suspect that if someone were to build a town called Lime, make
everything in the town out of lime, provide only foods that have
some connection to lime and then bury the Limeys in lime when
they're dead, 'Arry would move to that town in a flash and think
that he had arrived in Paradise on Earth.

According to my v-a-a-a-ast network of spies, sneaks and sleuths,
this next issue of The Last Straw focusses on lime... and to no one's
surprise, will feature some of the musings/wisdom/experience of our
Master of Lime, 'Arry .

Those same spies/sneaks/sleuths tell me that the format of this
next issue is a departure from the norm and may be a Beeg Surprise
to some.

Me ?  My curiosity is piqued and am itchin' to see this Limey
issue of The Last Straw and if you are afflicted with the same and
do not yet subscribe, it may not be too late:

3028,allen-p,"Folks,

I just found this interesting site about the history of the uses of lime and
development of pozzolonic materials ...lime and clay - Roman Cement -  that I
think will be interesting to the group.

I highly recommend David Moore's book ""The Roman Pantheon"" at $25.00  -   a
very thorough research into the uses and development of Roman Cement....lime
and clay/pozzolonic ash; the making and uses of lime in building. The book
covers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete.

I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily -
interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 years
learning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings,
structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash -  structures that have
lasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good
background information for sustainable builder folks.

Thank you, Mr. Moore. I highly recommend the site and especially the Book.
